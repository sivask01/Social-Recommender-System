0,"Every evening, the brave queen of Persia, Shahrazad, goes into the Sultan's rooms and begins a weave of words, hoping to entice the Sultan to let her live another night so she can continue her story. But Shahrazad has a big problem: She is running out of stories. With a delicate stroke of luck, a cripple girl, Marjan, ventures into the harem with her Aunt to sell various wares. As her Aunt is selling things, Marjan entertains some of the children with a story. Unbeknownst to Marjan, Shahrazad's sister, Dunyazad, has heard her telling the story. Marjan is taken directly to Shahrazad and asked to recount the story. The tale keeps the queen alive another night and the queen decides to keep Marjan.
 As her helper, Marjan has to go into the city and look for tales that the Sultan has not heard. She has several close calls with the Kathun, the voracious female who rules the harem and who is set against 
Shahrazad. Finally the Sultan proclaims that he will stop killing women every night. Unfortunately, Marjan is still in danger and has to be taken out of the city along with Zaynab, an old woman who assisted Marjan. 
 Since my mom suggested this book to me, I thought that it would be boring. It was quite the opposite. I was intrigued from the very beginning to the end. I loved the byplay between the characters and the thrilling escapes from various places. One thing that didn't please me was the ending. The ending was abrupt; the story just kind of stopped and left you wondering what happened next in Marjan's life. But all in all, this book was amazing and I have read and re-read it many times ",0,1332288000.0,73960,[],Elizabeth.Wong98,4.5,"Mar 21, 2012",8341,417961,2012-03-21,2012,3,0.0,0.0,2.25

Fortunately, hes got friends; unfortunately, their ideas tend towards the felonious. A bunch of comic setpieces strung together with bare connective tissue.

2,"I became privy to this book, when another author that I enjoy reading recommended it to her fans, as Brenna Yovanoff is one of her friends. The way she described the premise of the book and the author herself, made me want to look into reading it. I immediately knew when I saw the cover, all bets were off. This would definitely be a book that I would enjoy.
This book easily fits into a genre that I'm no stranger to, at the moment. Actually, haven't been for years, if I'm honest. I like the main character Mackie and the fact that he wants to nothing more to be normal, which is quite the opposite of what he actually is. I also enjoy the fact that Emma, his sister loves him for who he is and not necessarily what he is, and that Roswell comes across as a very understanding and supportive friend that he can count on. 
All throughout the back half half of this story, I found myself strongly associating the sacrifice of one of the town's baby with another short story I'd read years ago, The Lottery. The two stories are not exactly the same, but there is a thread of similarity there in that one sense. It's almost as if, they're sacrificing the one for the good of the many, and the towns people look the other way because they're too afraid to look at the truth. 
The character's that come out of the House of Mayhem just may very well be some of the most colorful, unique, and favorite character's ever among many. From the Morrigan to the little pink girl, to the dead girls, and Carlina Carlyle it was all so interesting. The history and the mythology there, the fact that there was a whole world that lay beneath the two of Gentry in the Slag Heap. 
Strange how sometimes something so ugly can come across so beautiful in ways that you couldn't begin to imagine, something that takes on a life of their own. Even the Lady and the Cutter, had their purposes. And the story seemed to re-iterate that when you give something a name, it gives that thing power - whatever it is. It's not exactly that these beings were evil and ugly, so much as they were just different and creepy and had their own agenda's and reasonings behind their actions. They were very well portrayed in everything they did or said. Nothing was without meaning.
The author's attention devoted to the imagery and detail of the story, showed in her vivid imagination, when creating The House of Mayhem and the spooky town of Gentry and all of the people and ugly things were part of what made this first published work of hers so phenomenal. 
The only drawback for me as far as this book goes, was the pacing of it. For me, personally, it started off pretty slow and didn't seem to really pick up and gain momentum until about half way into the story itself. But, all of that aside, I really wanted to finish this book because I truly felt like it had potential and the back half of it just did not disappoint me. The rich storytelling and the creative imagery that she wove into it, has made me enjoy this book in ways that I hadn't imagined I would.

6,"What PUN!
Having a sister was weird. It was like having a heart-shaped bruise. So says just-turned-eleven year-old Milton Fauster about his thirteen going on thirty-year-old sister Marlo, a bad seed who drags her hapless little bro down with her into Heck after an unfortunate marshmallow-bear explosion.
 
Heck is where the souls of the darned toil for all eternityor until they turn eighteen, whichever comes first, says Principal Bea Elsa Bubb. In Heck, Demons wield pitchsporks, the cafeterium serves over-cooked Brussels Sprouts, and even toddlers have been judged and assigned to a KinderScare facility. Richard Nixon teaches Ethics and Lizzie Borden Home Economics.
In this, his first novel, author Dale E. Basye was apparently determined to pack as many puns as possible into the narrative, with a plethora of descriptive phrases so adjective and adverb-intense I sometimes lost the gist of the sentence and had to re-read to get the full effect. For instance, it could just be me, but try to read the following straight through just once with full comprehension: A terrible grating metal squeak sliced through the cavern as an ornate iron decorated gate with sugared spikes, candied skulls, and barbed licorice labored open roughly forty feet behind the stage. I dont know about you, but I had to go back and wrap my mind around that gate.
And yeesh, the double-entendres and triple-entendres just wouldnt stop coming. Take this almost overbearingly puntastic sentence, Warped hula-hoops, two-wheeled tricycles, deflated basketballs, not-so-Hot Wheels, well-mannered Bratz, ex-Xboxes, and an astounding collection of Russian poetry lay scattered across the dingy grey carpet.
In adult literature, clichs are frowned upon, but here in Juvenile Fictionland, the more warped but still-recognizable the clichs, the better. And this book is juvenile fiction in the true spirit of the word, as author Basye doesnt hesitate to cross the gross line into disgusting territory. From the sulfur water thats like drinking a fart, to phrases like mind over fecal matter, and, (dear Lord, yes,) a VILE description of our hero narrowly avoiding getting shat upon by none other than Principal Bubb herself as he is attempting to escape Heck through the sewer system.
I have to comment on some editing issues that fully distracted me (being as how Im a writer who learned the rules the hard way: by committing each and every sin Pat Holt so succinctly lays out in his Ten Mistakes article here). Basye is fond of heavy use of his characters names instead of going with a personal pronoun where applicable. So, Marlo did this, Marlo did that, and Marlo did the other thing; where I would have been comfortable reading how Marlo did this, she did that and she did the other thing. And there was a lot of head-hopping going on; where instead of sticking to one persons point of view, the author slipped between characters thoughts within the same chapter. This is a sin strictly forbidden to first-time novelists, but Basyes editor seems to have forgiven it, maybe because the writing is bursting with those relentless (and sometimes quite clever) puns, and some people do love to groan.
Heck is a foul, vulgar place, despite the humor Basye uses to describe it, and maybe some of his young readers will come away from the mild underlying moral of the story (Be Good or Else), with a renewed appreciation forwellthe possibility of eternal consequences. I sincerely doubt the real Heck is as much pun.

9,"Beoordeling boek Grieselstate 
Het boek Grieselstate kan je plaatsen (zoals de titel al aangeeft) in de categorie griezelverhalen. Ook past het boek in de categorie humoristische verhalen omdat het verhaal op een soms hilarische manier omschreven wordt. Het thema van dit boek is gericht op hekserij. Ook wordt er de vriendschap omschreven tussen de drie hoofdpersonen David, Jill &amp; Jeffrey. Erg realistisch is het boek niet. De onderwerpen magie &amp; hekserij komen erg veel aanbod in dit boek, deze themas kom je in het dagelijks leven niet erg vaak tegen. 
David Eliot wordt op een dag van school gestuurd. Zijn ouders, die niet meteen de meest sympathieke ouders zijn, besluiten David in te schrijven voor een school genaamd: Grieselstate. Deze kostschool ligt gesoleerd op een klein eiland. Bij zijn aankomst in Grieselstate ontdekt David al snel dat er allerlei vreemde dingen gebeuren op deze al even onheilspellende school. Na een mislukte ontsnappingspoging van David, komt hij erachter dat hij terecht is gekomen op een griezelschool! Elke nacht rond twaalf uur lopen alle leerlingen de slaapzalen uit en gaan op weg naar een hol diep onder de grond. Hier leren de leerlingen de kracht van magie &amp; hekserij. 
Dit is een geweldig goed geschreven, spannend verhaal. De auteur vertelt dit originele verhaal met kleurrijke personages op een humoristische, soms zelf hilarische manier waarbij de nodige spanningselementen niet ontbreken. De beschrijvingen van Grieselstate en de directe omgeving zorgen ervoor dat de lezer een duidelijk beeld krijgt van de bizarre school en de al even bizarre leerkrachten en schoolhoofden. De lezer heeft de nodige fantasie nodig om zich met bepaalde gebeurtenissen te identificeren. Zo kan het hoofd van de school mensen laten verdwijnen en lijken alle leerlingen niet te kunnen/ willen praten. Jongeren of volwassene die dit boek lezen zijn aan het eind van de boek op zeker hoogte genformeerd over het thema hekserij. Dit thema wordt namelijk tot in de fijnste puntjes omschreven. Het verhaal leest als een trein en neemt je van het begin tot het einde mee in een rijke fantasiewereld vol spanning en avontuur.

10,"Innocents is basically the story of a 16 year girl who seduces her teacher. So enamored by her is he, that he quits his job, rents them a new house and takes her away from her life. They have sex constantly and she's constantly manipulating him.
It's written sort of as a letter. Somewhere in the first 50 pages or so we discover that she's writing down an account of their affair and that this account is being written to her lover / the teacher, at his request. There are many sentences that end with 'darling,' which is never pleasant.
I read this because someone I used to know was scandalized and titillated by it. While 16 year old girls aren't quite my cup of tea, I do have an interest in the darker sides of sexuality. However, it was written by a 19 year old. The audience was clearly people who wanted to be scandalized and titillated, without the benefit of actually having to consider alternative sexual lifestyles.
In summation : It bored me and I was not scandalized or titillated. ",0,1315094400.0,496505,[],agnesmack,1.0,"Sep 4, 2011",29081,347308,2011-09-04,2011,9,0.0,0.0,0.5

12,"You enter the moment of the naked lunch when you realize just what that is quivering at the end of your fork. Weve been staring at that living, gelatinous mass for 50 years now  and we still dont know what it is.
Its a novel. Its a poem. Its (as one shrill Amazon reviewer has it) the ranting of a LIBERAL ATHEIST JUNKY. Its (drug-induced or not, take your pick) stream-of-consciousness. Its the first prose cut-up. Its pornography. Its the end (or beginning) of (post-)modernism. Its The Bomb, its a how-to-be-a-writer manual. Heres the definitive answer to all that: Yes, it is. Naked Lunch is all that and more.
Naked Lunch is one of the most written-about books of the twentieth century. Its up there with Ulysses and The Wasteland for the title of book most likely to generate a graduate thesis. Thats because, like those other two, its an open text: youre quite likely to find there precisely what you go looking for.
Everything, that is (as a different Amazon reviewer complained) except stuff about lunch and nudity: doesnt anybody like to eat in the nude?
So what does this all add up to? It adds up to this: You should read Naked Lunch. Its an essential part of who we are (as Burroughs wrote somewhere, a paranoid is someone who knows something of whats going on; if youre not paranoid, youre not really alive). Its part of your education (did you know that language was a virus from outer space? Quick: read this book), its part of your sexual being (If I had my way wed sleep every night all wrapped around each other like hibernating rattlesnakes), its an essential document of the American Century (In the U.S. you have to be a deviant or die of boredom).
And Naked Lunch is a hell of a lot of fun  if your idea of fun is being burned at the stake and reincarnated as a dope fiend on the run from an evil doctor trying to get you to shoot bug powder while simultaneously being gang-buggered by the security forces of Interzone.
Really. Its that funny, that much fun. Heres a sample  the Benway mentioned below is the self-same doctor who wants you to shoot bug powder (a note: we dont do bug powder in this era of high-tech entomological toxins, but think roach poison and youve got the idea):
 Whats with the serum?
 I dont know, but it sounds ominous. We better put a telepathic direction finder on Benway. The mans not to be trusted. Might do almost anything Turn a massacre into a sex orgy
 Or a joke.
 Precisely. Arty type No principles
This fiftieth-anniversary edition is a beauty: cloth-bound, slip-cased, all purple and green in the style of the first Olympia edition (Paris, 1959) with a restored text faithful to Burroughs original composition (whatever that means; Burroughs didnt compose Naked Lunch; Allen Ginsburg assembled the book by collating extracts from letters written to him by Burroughs; with Naked Lunch, there are only ever variorum editions), and an insightful afterword by critic David Ulin. Forget the marketing hype and the DVD-like extras: at the price, this hardcover book is a great value. If I recall correctly (and I doubt that I do), Burroughs said something along those lines: Cheat your landlord (if you must), but dont shortchange the Muse.
So dont shortchange yourself. Read Naked Lunch, learn to write like a maniac, god-eating atheist dope-shooting creative genius, and then start a blog: let us know what you really think.

The Keene Act has outlawed superheroes as vigilantes. The superheroes have gone into retirement and some have not done so well in retirement, dying of alcoholism. A couple of superheroes are still employed as government agents, the Comedian and Dr. Manhattan. Rorschach who is more Nazi and sociopath is still active underground and states he will never retire.

It is also a multiple layer story with the tale of the Tales of the Black Freighter told in the background of the comic.

I think Kim Harrison has scarred me by killing off Rachel Morgan's vampire beau, because I can't help being convinced Eric is going to be ""dusted,"" to use a term from Buffy. And that's probably why I had to read it so quickly.

26,"The second of Kelli Stanley's noir series featuring private investigator Miranda Corbie begins on May 25, 1940, the opening day of the second season of the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco.
Miranda is called to the discovery of a murdered performer, a young model by the name of Pandora Blake, who was stabbed and then had an anti-Semitic insult written on her chest with her own blood. Even though Miranda is an employee of Sally Rand Enterprises, fair management tell her she's a ""security risk"" (because of the incidents in City of Dragons) and ask her not to return to the site.
Out of work, Miranda calls the paper to run her usual ads, but when her own lawyer, Meyer Bialik, asks her to investigate on behalf of his new client who has been arrested for Pandora Blakes's murder, she agrees.
Pleased that she can officially continue to delve into the case, Miranda begins immediately. In her usual style, Miranda approaches her investigation obliquely, and digs up a lot more corruption than she expected.
Kelli Stanley is such a master of noir one could swear that she's Raymond Chandler reincarnated, and Miranda Corbie is the epitome of hardboiled. Unusual for a female character perhaps, but completely believable nonetheless.
And Ms. Stanley makes of San Francisco during the early years of World War II come alive as though the she had actually been there. The amount of research this would have required is mind-boggling, and it's no surprise that she has a scholarly background.

 The New Order is a bright new future. It is a future that replaces the corrupting and illusory freedoms of so-called democracies and replaces them with a higher discipline. It has taken many, many years of planning, strategic political postings, scientific polling, demographic research, precise messaging and carefully monitored elections
In prison, Whit and Wisty discover and hone their magical abilities and realize its up to them to make a difference in the fight against the New Order.
Witch &amp; Wizard by James Patterson and Gabrielle Charbonnet is a YA novel that seems to be trying to cash in on the popularity of the Harry Potter series. Its not nearly as captivating, though. Im not sure if its because the concepts old or if its because the relationships arent explored as deeply. The story alternates between Wistys and Whits viewpoints and I found this confusing at times  the chapters are short and Id just get used to one narrator when the viewpoint would change.
This book was just okay for me. The action wasnt exciting enough and the characters just didnt draw me in. I think Witch &amp; Wizard is aimed at the young male, reluctant reader market, which I am definitely not a part of  hopefully it will appeal to them more than it did to me.

34,"I know I've been absent for a few days, but Dave has been ill and I've been staying close by him. While doing that, I read a book I downloaded free to my Kindle from Oceanview Publishers called Dead Air.
I had no idea what to expect from this book since I didn't know the authors, the series, or anything about it. However, I'm glad I tried it because I like the gutsy, caring heroine and the writing style of the authors. It served to keep my mind from wandering to my worries, which is a great recommendation under the circumstances.
The heroine, Sammy (Samantha) Greene, is a student at a private college in New England who is a reporter for the school radio station. Her boyfriend is a med student who frequently gets very put out that she gets so wrapped up in her stories that she forgets to meet him or call him. He doesn't understand that in this book at least, she is researching a story with deadly consequences.
The plot involves a research institute at the college, a new vaccine for AIDS, professors vying for tenure, and murder among other issues. The story is very well told and only difficult to figure out because of the motives of the people involved. It's easy to follow, not so easy to see how it will end, and bad for the fingernails because Sammy is in danger. 
I don't dare tell you any more except that the characters are well-drawn and the plot is a dandy. I do recommend this mystery novel highly and I'm going to look for more books in this series. ",0,1325376000.0,9354231,[],bjmitch,4.0,"Jan 1, 2012",33835,483013,2012-01-01,2012,1,0.0,0.0,2.0
35,"Is there a ghost at Hundreds Hall? This is the question left hanging over the reader at the conclusion of Sarah Waters' latest novel, The Little Stranger. I, for one, remain unconvinced; not fully prepared to accept the possibility, nor to dismiss it outright. Like Dr Faraday, I am determined to cling to my rationalist perspective and avoid jumping to conclusions. Many other readers, I am sure, will disagree, and this is perhaps the novel's greatest strength: its ability to tread the threshold of proof between the explainable and the supernatural, compelling its readers to wrestle with their own half-formed opinions and conclusions.
Unfortunately, the majority of this 'literary meat' is confined to the final two hundred pages of the novel, and even then, it is fairly thinly spread. To reach it  along with other interesting aspects, such as Faraday's mulish, almost treacherous determination in pursuing both Caroline and logical solutions to every mystery  readers will have to wade through an unbelievable amount of padding. Waters seems to enjoy hammering the decay of the house and estate to no end, robbing the novel of the brevity and subtlety it may otherwise have possessed. To an audience mired in endless text, this story can often feel like little more than an empty tragedy.
The Little Stranger is the kind of book that I would love to see reimagined as a novella: a potent experiment in how easily we are willing to suspend our disbelief when reading, and how we might apply our reasoning differently in a real world scenario. In this format  somewhere around the size of Alan Bennet's The Uncommon Reader, in my mind  I could see it as a volume I might pass on to friends in the hope of discussing their reactions, as well as all those literary touches that Waters would have reduced to sharp little references. One does not need to spend five pages exploring a building site, for example, to understand her point about the new England's plebeian multitudes breaching the gates of Hundreds. As it is, there is simply not enough material here to be spread across the epic, over-rendered novel that Waters has envisaged. The writing may be quite transporting, but it is easy to become fed up with the destination. ",1,1260057600.0,7609965,[],SamuelW,2.0,"Dec 6, 2009",23346,423660,2009-12-06,2009,12,0.0,0.0,1.0

38,"One of Terry Pratchett's first novels, and one of his very few pure science fiction ones too.
Kin Arad is a senior figure in a company which builds worlds, and is well rewarded by life-extending technologies, which make her nearly a few centuries old, despite looking relatively youthful. Her curiosity is piqued when a mysterious man from 1000 years past tells her of a disc-shaped world. She soon finds herself on a mission, with two other alien beings, to find and explore this world. After crash-landing there, they set off on an espedition to survive and escape, and at the same time discover the mechanism and origins of this bizarre place.
Although not nearly as accomplished as many of Pratchett's later Discworld novels, this book still has much humour, various sources to parody and highly inventive ideas. It is fascinating to read of another discworld, although the similarities are really only superficial. Unfortunately, there were some sections in the book that were a little slow, characters that were somewhat pedestrian and lifeless, and I ended up really disliking the eventual themes, partly because they were a bit predictable, but mainly because they were so unscientific - all on a par with the ridiculous religious notions that dinosaur bones are only a few thousand years old and just there to trick us.

40,"I usually have no problem reading historical romance series out of order. I can generally figure out what is going on pretty easily. This book I read without reading the previous two, and I was a bit more confused than usual on some plot points. But that didn't stop me from really enjoying this book.
It was the characters that drove this book. Andreas is cold, intense, and scarred inside and out. We get to spend a lot of time in his head. In fact the first 1/3 of the book is completely from his point of view. We find out he trusts and cares for only two people in his life. Everyone else he uses fear to keep them at a distance. He and his partner, Roman (the hero of the previous book), have created an empire for themselves in London. At the beginning of the book he is approached for help by our heroine, Phoebe.
Phoebe has come to Andreas for financial help. Her father made some unfortunate mistakes, and now their carriage business is heavily in debt. She confounds Andreas with her forwardness, optimism, and teasing. She pushes herself into his life and refuses to leave Andreas alone no matter how cold he is towards her. I loved their interactions; found myself laughing many times to Phoebe's teasing and Andreas' reactions.
So why not 5 stars? Because of their personalities, consuming attraction for each other, and fun interactions, I was really looking forward to their love scenes. I wanted to see Andreas' intensiveness and Phoebe's teasing in bed. There was one sex scene and it was lacking. It was very short and vague. I am not someone that always needs long, detailed sex scenes, but I think with these characters, it would have really added to the book.

She offers bulleted lists of reasons a particular type of relationship might be right for you; covers the special perils to watch out for in each type of relationship, with helpful advice; and ends each chapter with a profile of a person, couple, or group whose experience illustrates the theme of the chapter. Taormino's writing shows sensitivity and an open perspective toward all types of nonmonogamy and toward those who choose monogamy for themselves, as well.

47,"I read this book on my Kindle. It is the second book in The Edge series by husband and wife book writing team, Ilona Andrews. There are four books contracted for this series. You don't really have to read the first book, On the Edge, to enjoy this one; although some characters from the first book do make an appearance in this one.
Cerise Mar and her family own tons of land in the Mire, the Edge Swamplands, but they are poor. When Cerise's parents are captured by a feuding family; she is now the family's leader and will stop at nothing to get her parents back even if it does mean rekindling an ages old feud with the competing Mire family. But things are more complicated than Cerise could imagine. William, the changeling from the first book in the series, has been hired by the Mirror to track down an agent of the Hand (both factions represent nations of the Weird) named the Spider. William and Cerise find that their paths will cross and that Cerise's family feud may be connected to a silent war being waged between the Mirror and the Hand. 
I actually liked this book quite a bit more than On the Edge, and I liked that book a lot. The plot for this book is a lot more complex, there is more battle and more intrigue. This book also ties in more of the politics that are happening in the Weird and it was great to see more of the infrastructure that makes up the Wierd; we never got to see much of the Weird in the first book.
William and Cerise are wonderful characters. Cerise is tough and shoulders her responsibilites to her huge family well; she has some weak moments but that only makes her easier to love as a character. William is a wonderful match for Cerise, he is just as tough as Cerise and comes with a lot of baggage which makes him a realistic and lovable character as well. The chemistry between these two characters is amazing; you are really rooting for them the whole book. Even the side characters are unique and well developed. There are a number of side characters in the group of the Hand and in Cerise's family that could hold a story all their own; they are wonderfully complex and interesting.
This book is more of an urban fantasy than a paranormal romance. There are a couple steamy scenes between Cerise and William. William is one of those ""Mate-for-life"" alpha males which makes the story lean a little to the romance side at some points. That being said there is a ton of action and some truly awesome fight scenes in the book, and it is these type of scenes that make up the majority of the story. Nothing ever gets overly serious in this book; the characters have a great sense of humor and the dialogue and banter does an excellent job reflecting this.
As with ever other book I have read by the Andrews; the plot is tight, the fight scenes well done, the romance scenes well done, the book very engaging, great world-building, and lovable characters. Just a great book overall.
Overall this was a wonderful addition to this series. This book broadens the world we were introduced to in the first boo, On the Edge, and has a more complex story than the first book did. Cerise and William are tough characters who really kick-butt but are at the same time lovable. I can't wait to read the next book in this series to see what it adds to the story. Ilona Andrews has quickly become an author who can do no wrong as far as I am concerned...everything I have read by this husband and wife team has been wonderful. Definitely check out their Kate Daniels series; I love that series just as much as, if not more than, this series. If you enjoy this series and the Kate Daniel's series I highly recommend the following Jaz Parks by Jennifer Rardin, Elemental Assassin by Jennifer Estep, Dorina Basarab by Karen Chance, and Jane Yellowrock series by Faith Hunter. All feature tough female characters and highly developed, creative worlds that lean more towards urban fantasy than paranormal romance.

Some have called this the funniest book in the English language. I would most certainly not go that far. It <u>is</u> a funny book, but you'll need an appreciation of poking fun at a slapstick group of self-satisfied, pampered Victorians (think Bertie Wooster without Jeeves' sobering influence) or else you should pass this by and spend your time elsewhere.

The Automats are no more, but this book is filled with all the nostalgia of the concept and the famous chain.

Blue Flutes One Hundred Leaves starts with a brief introduction to Japanese poetry and explains how this volume came to be. This introduction, though sparse, is informative and prepares you to better understand Japanese poetry. Next come the actual poems. Each one is presented first in English, then we get the Japanese Kanji and a transliteration. It is interesting to see where the poems came from and I find the characters beautiful as well. Lastly, there are literary notes that help with the interpretation of the poem. These literary notes come in very handy. They provide better understanding of the circumstances surrounding the poem really help in appreciating them.
Each poem has an accompanying piece of artwork that depicts its theme. They are wonderfully matched, some combinations seeming as though one was made for the other. Unfortunately, the artwork is also where we hit the first real drawback: the art is not named, the artist is not mentioned. The book is not in color, and I would like to look up full color versions. Thats made very hard, though, when I dont have a name to search with. The fact that the book is in black and white in the first place is unfortunate, but I knew that it would be and I can forgive that. 
As for the actual poetry, I can flip to any page and find an interesting poem. Some I contemplate more than others. There are those that I like instantly, and those that take a bit longer to appeal to me. Others never really leave much of an impression. Theres bound to be something for everyone though.

59,"How have I not reviewed this yet?! I've read it at school visits, storytimes, more school visits, and it's circulated so heavily since we got it last May that I've already had to tape the pages a couple times.
The premise of the story is simple: You have a shark. You have a train. You have a series of increasingly insane situations. Who wins? Well, it all depends...if they're underwater, falling through the air, eating pies, having a burping contest, choosing board games, bowling....you get the idea.
The story is framed spreads of two small boys playing with their toy train and shark. Older kids will quickly realize of course, that it's all in the boys' imagination. But who cares if you know it's real or not? It's FUN! A marvelous interactive book for storytime - some of the situations are obvious, some are a little tricky, so be prepared to mediate between Team Shark and Team Train when there's a reasonable doubt. If you have a smaller, older group of kids, they'll enjoy reading the speech bubbles. With a younger, bigger audience it's better to stick to the basic text and focus on the kids' interaction, as you discuss the various advantages.
Lichtenheld's art is stunningly hilarious, peppered with small jokes and effortlessly conveying the craziness of the situations with a bulging eye or wildly waving train wheels. The story and art blend seamlessly together to create a truly humorous story, perfectly in tune with the way real kids play, and enjoyable for the whole family.
Verdict: A must have for your libary. Read it at storytimes, on school visits, and to random children walking through the library. Create your own shark vs. train scenarios (Teddy Bear vs. Squirrel! Clouds vs. Airplanes! Zombies vs. Unicorns! You get the idea) or have a Shark vs. Train party with shark and train hats and various challenges for the teams.",0,1288569600.0,9570858,[],JeanLittleLibrary,4.0,"Nov 1, 2010",12192,490236,2010-11-01,2010,11,0.0,0.0,2.0

J. R. Ward is back with one of my most anticipated books this year, Lover Reborn. We now follow Tohrment, the brother who wiped himself off the face of the Earth when his shellan and unborn child were murdered. He is back due to a fallen, selfish, and smartass angel, Lassiter. But he is nowhere close to being the vampire he use to be. He is on a rampage. Along with his rampage, he has been having horrible nightmares where his shellan and child aren't safe and warm in the Fades, but stuck in a dreary and dark place. He soon finds out that they are stuck in the In Between. If Tohrment can't learn to move on and let go, his shellan and child will be lost in oblivion forever.
Wooooow! Ward has delivered again. And that delivery came with some punches. People have questioned why is there only a man on the cover. There is always a guy plus his lady. Now it makes sense. This is more than a romance, it is a journey. A journey to get out of the past and move on. To let go and be free. And Tohrment's journey is one I was glad to be apart of.
Tohrment was well...truly tormented. He just couldn't get out of the cage he built around him. I love that No'One is the leading lady. She was soft spoken and kept to herself, but when Tohr and her are interacting, I love the personality she has. She belonged to a royal family before her heartbreaking story and you can tell. I love that she came to make amends with Xhex and understood and loved her no matter who her father was. Lover Reborn truly portrayed the hurdles Tohr and No'One must jump over, not only for their families and each other, but for themselves.
I really enjoyed the side story of Xhex and John. They are newlyweds, but they show that even though they are finally together, things aren't perfect. Not even close. John didn't like that Xhex was out fighting because he didn't want to end up like Tohr. Xhex has been an assassin and a fighter even before John was born (well technically given we know who John really is). So I love that we got that because Xhex is nothing like the other shellans, so it makes sense that their relationship would be different. I also must put out there, I am on Xhex's side. Ease up John, goodness!
I also love that we got a lot more of the Band of Bastards. We aren't getting much of the lessers as earlier in the series, but the B.O.B. definitely form a bigger threat. Xcor is more determined than ever. But I like that we see he has a heart...sort of. He definitely cares for his brothers. And someone more, but I won't say who. I love that we get more of Qhuinn and Blay. They truly can't stay far from each other. And I loved the friendship between Layla and Qhuinn and w get some insight into her life. I know Qhuinn and Blay's book is up next and I can see why. There are some life changing events that take place that will make their book very exciting. I can't wait.
And than we have newbie named Assail. I am not sure if he is a bad guy or good guy just yet. But even though he looks like any other super rich, over pampered guy, don't underestimate him. He kind of scares me. I believe Ward said he will play a bigger part in the BDB, I can't remember, but I am keeping my eyes peeled for sure. And then we have my absolute favorite character in this book, Lassiter. I am so in love with this guy. It is impossible not to love him. He is hilarious and truly unpredictable, both with his actions and the things that come out of his mouth. I am dying for him to get his own book. That would be the greatest thing ever.
Let me say it now, Lover Reborn will make you mad a couple of times especially close to the end. I don't think I cursed so loud at the ending of a book since Dreamfever. Not to mention the times I wanted to punch Tohr for being so stubborn. He did and said some things to No'One or others that deserved a slap or two. I understood his anger and how he felt he was deceiving Wellsie in some way. But come on man! I did love the literal punch in the nuts, that actually brought a tear to my eye.
Obviously I can go on forever, so I will slow my roll here. I absolutely loved this book. All the chaos and emotions really gets you going. Not to mention those sex scenes. Just a warning, don't read this at work. This book will really drive you nuts and it is so worth it. The BDB is one of the first PNR books I have read and it is still one of the best series out there. Again, if you haven't started this series, you really need to get on it now.

64,"Some of the words from the back cover that are descriptive of this book are thriller, action-adventure, noir metafiction, thrilling twists of this stylish, Escher-like mystery. The front cover compares it to Umberto Eco (the Latin?) and Anne Rice (demons?). I havent read Anne Rice so just guessing. The Club Duma is the story of a book detective, Lucas Corso who is hired to track down rare editions for the wealthy and the unscrupulous. This book is a bibliophiles dream, filled with references of old and great novels. Corso finds himself living fragments of Dumass story as he hunts down the authenticity of a section titled The Anjou Wine. At the same time he is researching a book of The Book of the Nine Doors for another client. Corso begins to be lost between reality and the surreal. 
What I liked about the book is the mystery and tension and I also liked reading about the literary world. What I didnt like is the two separate plot lines, while both interesting, never seemed to meld quite well enough. If the author had only wrote about the Dumas it would have been short and probably not very interesting. I enjoyed learning about old editions and the people who work with old editions and those that love them. I found myself over and over wishing I had read The Three Musketeers and various other works before I read this. I learned a lot about Dumas and hope I can get to one of his books in the near future.

This was a very good continuation of the series. Pettersson set up the next book very well, but I didn't have the feeling while I was reading this book that the entire purpose of this story was to set up the next one.
It was nice to see more of Hunter. I expect he'll play a big role in the next book. I'm hoping he doesn't actually turn to the shadow side, that would be repetitive after this book. While I think Jo/Olivia was right about needed to figures things out herself before getting involved with another man, I would like to see them together. I like Hunter and I'm not entirely convinced why he still wants Jo other than ""it feels good."" But at least he's mostly avoided the ""you've said no but I'm going to keep pursuing you stalker-like but it's okay because we're meant to be together"" trap. He made it clear he wants her, but mostly he's left her alone except when she comes to him.
I really didn't mind losing Ben. It had been a while since I'd read the other books so I'd forgotten a lot about him and no longer had a feel for their relationship. Ben himself appeared only briefly. This may all have been intention on Pettersson's part, after all, the point was that Jo/Olivia was holding on to the idea of Ben more than Ben himself.
It looks like there will be some significant changes in the next book. I'm looking forward to seeing how it all plays out. ",0,1232150400.0,4224078,[],schnaucl,4.5,"Jan 17, 2009",73091,319726,2009-01-17,2009,1,0.0,0.0,2.25

Where to start? First off, be prepared for a rave; I thought this one was FABulous!
A quick note: This one has been compared to To Kill a Mockingbird and The Help. While it WAS great, I can definitely say that it seems lighter than those two books - not as complex or layered, but it DOES address many of the same issues in the voice of Starla, a precocious, sassy 9 1/2-year-old (remember, that 1/2 really matters at that age). 
First lines:
My grandmother said she prays for me every day. Which was funny, because I'd only ever hard Mamie pray, ""Dear Lord, give me strength."" That sure sounded like a prayer for herself - and Mrs. Knopp in Sunday school always said our prayers should only ask for things for others. Once I made the mistake of saying that out loud to Mamie and got slapped into next Tuesday for my sassy mouth.
It is 1963 in Cayuga Springs, Mississippi. Starla is being raised by her maternal grandmother ""Mamie"", who is 45 years old and seems to resent having her around. Mamie's biggest fear is that Starla will turn out like her mother Lulu, who has been in Nashville, working on a recording career, since Starla was three years old. Her father works further down South on an oil rig, so Starla only sees him sporadically.
When Starla sticks up for a girl she doesn't even really like, she finds herself in trouble AGAIN .. grounded ... on one of the best days of the year - the Fourth of July. When she sneaks out anyway, she runs into a nosy neighbor and things get worse from there. 
Starla takes it into her head to run away and find her mother in Nashville. Her mom will be so happy to see her that she'll let her stay, and her daddy will come join them, and they will be a family again. So she starts walking ... and walking .. and walking .. until she is picked up by a black woman named Eula who, strangely, has a white baby with her. 
Thus begins Starla's journey into a world that she didn't know existed. On her journey, she finds herself and others in dangerous situations, discovers the true meaning of family and friendship, and begins to glean an understanding of civil rights and the effect of segregation. Never having experienced true poverty, she is astonished to find that not everyone has electricity and running water, and as she discovers Eula's history, she begins to get an idea of true injustice.
Starla's voice is utterly believable. Like any child her age, things are pretty much black and white (until they're not). As you travel with her, be prepared for the good and the bad, for laughter and tears, for heart-stopping situations as well as heart-warming ones. This sassy little protagonist will convince you of the truths of her story - you should definitely go along for the ride with her.
QUOTES:
Everybody in Cayuga Springs treated my momma like a secret. But it seemed like I was the only person they wanted to keep the secret from. Sometimes when Mamie had bridge club in the summer, I'd sit below the living-room window outside and listen. The ladies had plenty to say about Momma, all right. Hateful things. Lies. They squeezed them in between their bids and trumps, like it was part of the game.
That kind of crazy liked to hide behind a mask and you never knew when it was gonna come out.
""Oh, child, the law wouldn't do nothin'. A white man can do pretty much whatever he wants to a colored woman and a little girl - even if the little girl is white. It the way things are round here.""
Once when I was in first grade, Patti Lynn and me was talking to each other across the aisle just by movin' our lips, not even makin' a whisper. Mrs. Kessler heard our lips movin'. She made us both stand at the front of the class until recess. Teacher hearing was as good as Superman's.

70,"I received this book as an extremely thoughtful gift from one of our puppy buyers. We breed and show Airedale Terriers. 
The Airedale subject of this book, however, is Mr. B. Wake Up Mr. B! by Penny Dale is the story of a young girl named Rosie who wakes up before everyone else in her family and despite her best efforts to rouse the other household members the only one who wants to play that early is of course Mr. B the Airedale.
Light on words this book really shines in the illustrations which are beautiful. Page after page the detail in each frame is amazing. Mr. B is a wonderfully drawn Airedale with great color, slightly shaggy, and a too short for my personal taste tail. His eyes are particularly well crafted, slightly sleepy at first, and at once loving, curious, and tolerant of little Rosies antics. Mr. B is a true Airedale taking care of Rosie and having some fun along the way.
This book is a wonderful addition for any Airedale lovers library or as a gift for a dog loving older child. Airedales make great family pets as evidenced in this book and in real life. The Airedale in this book truly loves this child and as any well trained Airedale would he puts up with all of the girls behavior in a way that truly shows his bond to this active young lady. As always, children and dogs should never be left alone together unsupervised as not all are as tolerant as Mr. B.

71,"The book is composed of fifteen short essays and an introduction by the editor. The chapters move chronologically over the historical documents of Los Angeles. The essays cover some very esoteric works but for that reason the book is valuable as a reference guide. The book begins with a general chronology of influential books, movies, and current events. Each chapter concludes with end notes. There is a guide to further reading and index. The volume is planned to touch on each of the mythic elements of Los Angeles which continue to fascinate the world. The various authors are free with their critiques of the city, its people, and its ideals but there is an honest attempt to put those views into a wider ongoing reflection on Los Angeles. Adorno figures in several essays, as do Huxley, Chandler, and Waugh. The work by the Americans Didion, Mosley, and Valdez are given multiple considerations. One strange thing finds itself repeated several times. A few essays speak of the riots after the verdicts of the LAPD officers whom were acquitted of harming Rodney King as the Justice Riots. No one refers to the riots with that phrase. Justice Riots would be a way to distinguish them from the Watts Riots but no one would know what you were speaking about if you happened to live in Los Angeles and referred to them in that way. The essays are all brief and therefore unable to do more than scan an area of interest. But, thankfully, they are each well crafted.

76,"Tom Perrotta writes about ordinary people, living ordinary lives in suburbia. In his previous books, hes told the tale of young suburban parents falling into an extra-marital affair (Little Children), of a New Jersey student who goes to Yale and learns how to integrate his persona as the son of a lunch-truck driver with that of an Ivy League student (Joe College), and of a high school sex-ed teacher whose career is jeopardized after admitting to her students that people may engage in oral sex because they like it (The Abstinence Teacher). Even the central dramatic events in these (very good) books are, well, ordinary.
The Leftovers is different. While its again about ordinary people living in suburbia, the novel takes place after a most extraordinary event: the Sudden Disappearance in which millions of people around the world have vanished. Its a rapture-like event, except that unlike the rapture, the people in Perrotts book just literally disappear rather than flying into the sky, and unlike the rapture, there appears to be no rhyme or reason to which people disappear. Those who do include Hindus and Buddhists and Muslims and Jews and atheists and animists and homosexuals and Eskimos and Mormans and Zoroastrians, as well as a whole bunch celebrities: John Mellencamp and Jennifer Lopez, Shaq and Adam Sandler, Miss Texas and Greta Van Susteren, Vladimiar Putin and the Pope. The Sudden Disappearance happens on Oct. 14, and the multiple references to Oct. 14 are clearly intended to recall Sept. 11, and the thousands who suddenly disappeared that fateful day.
Perrottas novel begins three years after the Sudden Disappearance and focuses on the residents of the Mapleton who were left behindthe leftovers. Theyve responded in two ways. Some, like Kevin Garvey, have tried to regain the ordinary lives they led prior to Oct. 14, doing things like running for mayor and joining a softball team, while others, like Kevins wife Laurie, adopt extreme and unusual behaviors. Laurie, for example, joins the G.R.the Guilty Remnantsa cult who members wear white, refuse to speak, and wander around town smoking cigarettes and staring atwatchingpeople outside the G.R. Another cult eschews baths and shoesallowing just the slight leniency of flip-flops when theres snow on the groundwhile a third gathers around a prophet who offers healing hugs, but also turns out to have a penchant for impregnating underage girls. And then theres the Rev. Matt Jamison, who is so disappointed that he has been left behind that he makes it his personal mission to out all the infidelities and petty crimes of those who have disappeared.
Perrotta makes clear that both types of response to an event like Oct. 14 (and thus, Sept. 11?) are fraught with problems. The craziness of the cults is evident, but so is the craziness of trying to resume an ordinary life: to do so is to behave in ways that cant be anything but absurd. Here is Perrotta describing a Thanksgiving dinner: What a beautiful bird, they kept telling one another, which was a weird things to say about a dead thing without a head. And then . . .cousin Jerry had made everyone post for a group photograph, with the beautiful bird occupying the place of honor. And here, he depicts an announcement at the City Council Meeting: Congratulations to Brownie Troop 173, whose second annual gingerbread cookie fund-raiser netted over three hundred dollars for Fuzzy Amigos International, a charity that sends stuffed animals to impoverished indigenous children in Ecuador, Boliva, and Peru. What would pass without comment during a normal time becomes downright ludicrous when huge numbers of people have just evaporated. 
And yet, the books ending makes clear Perrottas real belief about how we must respond to tragedy. After an unexpected revelation about the G.R. that wallops the reader, there is a further tidying of loose ends that leaves one with hope about the future of those characters who have determined that they will go on living their ordinary lives.

synopsis from B&amp;N ( so many details, I don't want to accidentally give any spoilers)
Audrey Niffenegger's innovative debut, The Time Traveler's Wife, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry finds himself periodically displaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity from his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing.
The Time Travelers Wife depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare's marriage and their passionate love for each other, as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals -- steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable. 
My review
I loved this book. I was so caught up in the lives of Henry and Clare. I didn't find it hard to keep track of the story despite all the time traveling as, Niffenegger always tells what year and how old Henry and Clare are.
The story is presented from both Henry and Clare's point of view, and despite the fact that I don't believe in time travel (maybe I do now though), it wasn't at all silly.
Henry has no control over his time travel, it happens like a seizure. He mostly travels to places in his own past or his own future. When he meets Clare as a little girl he has to be careful not to give her many details of the future. But he does tell her that they get married, but not when she will meet him in her present time. And sometimes Clare sees two Henrys at once, which makes for an interesting wedding. But Clare worries every time Henry travels. He can't take anything with him, so he is always naked, not fun in Chicago in the middle of winter. He learns how to pick locks and wallets to survive. Often when Henry is waking up naked in the street in the middle of the night, he is a target for danger.
This book was just so well-written, intriguing, and heart-felt. I am so glad I did not miss this, even if I am late.

It tells of a Chinese soldier sent to Korea in 1951 where he is captured after being wounded. He is restored to health by an American surgeon and spends the time till 1953 in POW camps run by Americans. There is some brutality suffered by POWs but they in turn are rebellious and always seeking to do harm to their captors. In most memoirs by POWs one sympathizes with the POW but often one is repelled by the Chinese Communists' behavior as they seek to bedevil their captors. There is real suspense as to what will happen to the central character, who wants to go home to his moher and girlfriend but fears what will happen to him in Communist China, where any one captured is looked on as disgraced.

85,"The Bone Trail is a mystery thriller inspired by actual events involving wild horses, a gold mining company and the Bureau of Land Management(BLM).
Wild Horse advocates Lindy Abraham and Julia Evans are frustrated with the BLM's efforts to keep them from protecting the Wild Mustangs of Nevada. They are at constant war with the government officials who are supposed to help the horses but instead, pave the way for mining companies to take more land for their mining purposes. When that occurs, the wild horses that roam the land are relocated, while some may go to ranches for adoption, most are sent to slaughter houses to be sold as meat overseas where it is considered a delicacy.
Lindy and Julia have had enough and decide to do some investigation of their own. What they find appalls and dismays them when they stumble upon an enclosure filled with wild horses in different states of death. They film the horrific events on video, hundreds of horses are either dead or dying however, before they can share with the world what the BLM is allowing to happen, they go missing. 
Kate Wyndham, investigative journalist and horsewoman, is asked to find out what happened to the two women. With great apprehension, she had recently lost her own horse and her pain was unbearable, she begins her research and follows the clues to the events that lead to the disappearance of Lindy and Julia. Along her journey she enlists the help of Jim Ludlow, a local rancher and a Shoshone horse whisperer, a recovering alcoholic whose marriage recently disintegrated. Together the two uncover the truth and find love along the way.
I like how the author, Nell Walton, used humour in the story. The blend of both the horror of the situation and the chuckle humour dispersed throughout the book gave The Bone Trail a natural balance. I liked that there wasn't a lot of play between Jim and Kate before they came together, many books get bogged down with that interaction and if I wanted it, I would pick up a Harlequin, in life, instant attractions almost never drag out. I would've liked to have seen more from the mining company and BLM officials, I think adding some of their seediness to the book would have given it an extra edge that would of only given more credit to the issue of Wild Horse advocacy. The Bone Trail is heavy in expletives and the horse scenes may be disturbing for some but the book is a great read and I would recommend to anyone who has a love of horses.
SYNOPSIS:
The Bone Trail is a story of love, loss and murder set in modern day Nevada. While searching for a clandestine wild horse roundup, two wild horse preservation advocates have disappeared in the desert without a trace. When journalist Kate Wyndham and Shoshone Native and horse whisperer Jim Ludlow set out to discover what happened to them they find themselves caught up in a web of deceit, intrigue and corruption that threatens everything they hold dear and may even claim their lives.

88,"The title translates: Solitude and Sex and Pity. The book shuttles between parallel narratives. Opening on Christmas Eve, a gigilo and a homeless intruder improbably connect with each other after she breaks in to his apartment. An unemployed latin teacher befriends a barkeeper, a black American woman. A yuppie professional calmly informs her husband of six years that he must leave immediately because she would simply feel better if he were not around. These fragments and several other plot lines gradually begin to intersect as Krausser weaves the threads into a tapestry. The book is edgy, full of dark humor, and it captures the raw dynamism of contemporary Berlin. The approach is very similar to another of my favorite authors, David Schckler, especially Kissing in Manhattan.

90,"(Alistair) Well, this - I think - is not the first time I have read the Space Trilogy, since I have dim memories of reading them once before, but if so, those memories are from a sufficiently long time in the past as to have passed almost beyond recall, and so, in effect, I am coming to it for the first time again.
Anyway, let it be said that I have found this book satisfying on two levels: as science fiction alone, it is suitably satisfying, for its well-drawn aliens - the hrossa, sroni and pfifiltriggi of Malacandra, and in the planetary romance of Dr. Ransom, finding himself shanghaied to said planet from Earth, the Silent Planet of the title, and as much a mystery to its inhabitants as they to him. The portrayal of the relationships between the different hnau - sophont races/beings -, including humanity in the form of Dr. Ransom, is also refreshing when compared with the instinctive xenophobia so many writers feel the need to assume. Interesting reflections on language; and, finally, rather decent cosmology by the standards of 1938, I should think.
Of course, in reading C. S. Lewis, one must also consider the ways in which his work is informed by his Christian faith, something which I personally feel does not detract from, and indeed is enhanced by, its quality as a work of science fiction. (The comparison to a more modern writer of Christian fiction is, alas, telling.) The portrayals of the eldila - effectively angels - and the allegories, ethics and philosophy are woven well into the work, and should not offend, but rather be of interest to, all but the closest-minded of atheists, as they indeed were to me.

This book does go off into some fanciful, poetic language while attempting to describe poetry.

This story would best work with an intermediate level group who're learning about poetry and/or Emily Dickinson.

100,"This Southern lit is a story of sad and desperate people making sad and desperate decisions. There is lots of family drama, lots of mistakes and regrets, there is hope and heart. Some of the writing is lovely.
The readers are told on the first page that Zeke, now an adult, lost his brother to a drowning incident ten years ago. We aren't told the circumstances, but learn that Carter was Zeke's twin, special in ways that mean learning is hard for him, he has a gentle soul, and he relies on his brother to help get him through life.
Zeke's whole life is colored by his brother and what happened to him.
I liked this characters in this book, and I liked the slow-moving story of family. The only reason I didn't rate this novel just a little higher is that there were too many references to Carter's drowning, which was perhaps supposed to be suspenseful but became just a bit annoying. Yes, I understand how it changed everything, I understand how important it was in the life of Zeke and his family, but I felt like I was being hit over the head with its importance.

104,"Flynn is a good writer but I found the novel repelling in its darkness and graphic descriptions. At times, it felt like she was writing more for the ""shock value"" than for the fullness of the story. Other times, I was impressed by the depth of her characters and their emotions. I guess it was a like/dislike book for me. 
I was a little put off by some of her descriptions of Kansas, Missouri and the Kansas City area. We're not as ugly or disturbed as she often described the places and people. Still I give her the 3.5 stars because of how well she described the ugliness she decided to emphasize.

105,"Another wonderful Amish story to add to the many, many, many Amish novels that I have read. This is book 1 in Mary Ellis' Amish series, The Miller Family series, and I am so glad that I had the chance to review this tender story of love, forgiveness, family and heartache. 
When I think of the Amish, I automatically think of the easy life they have, but in reality, they have struggles too. Many of the same struggles that we Englishers often have, and one of them being the death of a husband or a wife. In A Widow's Hope, that is exactly what Hannah is dealing with: the death of her husband, and the hope to love again. When another Amish widower enters the picture, it is a story that will make you laugh, cry and settle right in with all the wonderful characters. 
I give this book a 5 star rating and high recommendations. I am looking forward to reading and reviewing book 2 in this series, Never Far From Home. If you like Amish and you love God, grab a copy of this book by a wonderfully talented author and experience a lightening of the heart through this simple easy read of Amish life.

107,"The Stranger You Seek by Amanda Kyle Williams is a debut novel about a series killer in Atlanta, pursued by a private investigator whose primary business of late is pursuing bail jumpers, serving summonses, etc. I think I'm at the saturation point with serial killers and profilers. All the profiles have started to sound remarkably alike. Thank God this one did not toss in a yet another short history of the most notable of them (but Ted Bundy did get a mention, I seem to recall). The writing is quite good, well-paced, good tension,with a number of interesting and likable characters. There is occasional, well-placed humor, particularly during a Thanksgiving Day get-together, complete with a laugh-out-loud toast and grace. There is also a very brief but interesting chapter describing the South, very perceptive and amusing. But the serial killer thing for me was a bit of a drag, and I found fault with a couple of sections of the book which may not bother other readers as much. First, sometimes I was confused about whose POV I was hearing. Then there is an opportunity to get a good description of the killer, an opportunity that is not pursued by the characters nor the author very aggressively - I conclude that because the killer's description conflicted with one of the ending twists, and the author was somewhat boxed in by the story's development. Note that I said twistS. I thought one would have been fine, and plausible. But there was a second, and I thought that was a real stretch. BUT, there are a lot of pluses in TSYS, and I will probably read the next installment of this series, but if it's another serial killer thing, maybe not..... 3 1/2 stars, completed 9/28/11 ",0,1317254400.0,11144527,[],maneekuhi,3.5,"Sep 29, 2011",60324,45918,2011-09-29,2011,9,0.0,0.0,1.75

However, the book suffers from inbuilt obsolescence, largely due to the Internet being a far better source for such trivialities as 'Easter Eggs'; also, because from the moment it was published it was already out of date.

111,"Situations
In ""Teen Girls Need L.O.V.E.,"" S. Dodson focuses on rampant issues plaguing teens today, which is very necessary as more and more teens choose to suffer in silence. While I appreciate that this book is available, I wish that S. Dodson would've elected to delve further into not just mentioning drunk driving, self-esteem, body types, HIV, sex, bullying, peer pressure and stress, but addressing it in detail. For example, she mentions a teenage girl contacting HIV after deciding to participate in a pregnancy pact and how in the end she talks to teens all over. But someone reading this story doesn't get to connect this story to their life if they are living in this realm. Surely there is life after HIV, but you have to at the very least acknowledge that your life is completely changed after this. 
As a mom, sister, aunt and cousin of teens, I pride myself on keeping the doors of communication open, with the intent of assisting them through these very difficult years. 
""Teen Girls Need L.O.V.E."" is full of motivating mantras and has a couple of exercises for the teens to answer questions. I hope that in part 2 she digs deeper. I believe once she does, this book would have a much more profound effect. 
GOALS: Inspire, motivate, transform... I really, really love this!

115,"I picked up this book after reading the first poem (which is rare for me, to have something leap out in such a way) and after noticing a nice list of ""notes"" at the back (nothing like a well-researched book of poems in conversation with other sources to whet my appetite), and finished it in one sitting (I'll admit, I couldn't put it down). With so many book awards out there I often am let down by the ""winner"", but I can honestly say this book clearly deserved to win the Bakeless Prize (recognizing there is much of my own aesthetic at work here to justify me saying this--another might take issue with the aesthetics represented in this book as I take issue with the aesthetics of the books that win that I don't like).I liked the concept of vellum as a title that unifies the book. Vellum (processed animal hide) was historically important for both written manuscripts and for paintings, speaking of which, the ekphrasis in this book is lovely--not obtrusive or done in a ""name-dropping"" way, but in a legitimate use of metaphor: I connect X to Y in my head, this object or angle of light or color I see echoes, calls forth, and sometimes even differs from this painting or photograph I once saw and is relevant to the meditation at hand. The speaker of these poem-meditations is a working, searching, questioning mind, probing the sensory world around him with the immediate pleasure of detailed description, and the layered pleasure of relating what he sees to other stories, works of art, other experiences he's had. I was also struck by the creativity and experimentation in the well-structured stanzas and lines. My only quibbles: relying too often on catalog, the cataloging of images, objects, etc. rather than focusing a little more intently on fewer objects in the list; and a love for, and at times overuse of a certain rhythm, especially when listing in threes: ""An axe, a bowl, some bread"" or ""macadam, a Florentine mosaic, Louie Louie's three slurred chords"", etc.Lastly I just have to say how impressed I am at the stylistic unity through the poems and how subjects as varied as Audubon, Rorschach tests, Dante's Inferno, Houdini, Montezuma, Charlie Chaplin, the Congo, a lynching in San Antonio, the Sistine Chapel, Saint Catherine, Keats and Severn, objects from the Mutter Museum of medical oddities in Philly, and artists from Giotto to Muybridge to Pollack and Picasso and many more all hold together: they all make sense in relation to each other in the world of this book in large part due to the consistent tone, speaker's voice, and inquisitive approach to material.

125,"Inspector Samejima is once again patrolling the mean streets of Shinjuku in a second outing in the popular Japanese police series. This time around there's a notorious assassin who is reportedly after a Taiwanese Mafia boss that has fled to Japan to escape retribution after betraying the hit man and costing him the woman he loved. The killer, known as Du Yuan (The Poison Ape), will stop at nothing to reach his target even if he has to go through all of the Yakuza to get there. There also seems to be a renegade Chinese cop after the assassin too and it all adds up to big trouble for the Shark. Can he prevent a bloodbath occurring or will he just have to stick around to mop up the pieces when the dust settles?
This episode in the life of the Shinjuku Shark seems more of a pulp novel than noir/police procedural of the first instalment. It takes a few chapters for the main story arc to get going but when it does the body count rises freely. This is much more violent than its predecessor and involves the rape and torture of a club hostess (prostitute in all but name) who becomes attached to the hit man. There is very little in the way of continuity from the previous book with subsidiary characters only appearing briefly, which in the case of Sho (Samejima's girlfriend) is quite a shame. This is definitely a stand-alone novel with no development of the back-story for the Shark's career stall so anyone who feels inclined can read this without picking up the first.
While Samejima is a good character the story didn't quite grab me as much this time around. Maybe it was that there was more time spent away from the main character while the others were fleshed out. The reliance on a medical condition, which could have easily been resolved, for a plot device always seemed to jar unnecessarily when it reared its ugly inflamed appendix. If the third in the series ever gets translated then I will pick it up as the relationships of the main character are interesting and I find the setting appealing also.

Lots of decent plot twists and character flip-flop behaviors. There was some good sex too, and awesome violence! 
This was Morgan's first book, so I understand that his craft hadn't been perfected yet. That said, this book had an overabundance of adverbs. It seemed like at least one out of ever four sentences ended with an adverb annoyingly. And Morgan used some strange and unnecessary adverbs quite often redundantly. It didn't make the writing bad, just became a big distraction on several occasions frequently.
The science was very well thought out, the way society has developed a system of human sleeves, where a soul can be downloaded in a new body when you messed up the one you started with. This led to some rather strange plot twists as well, but was pretty cool and unique.
Overall, I rather enjoyed his story. I'd probably be interested in reading the other two books in the series, as well as other stuff by Morgan. All I'd read to this point was The Steel Remains. Sadly though, all I remember from that book was gay elf-sex. 
I'm hoping that the tale of Takeshi Kovacs will stick with me better than that.

131,"Charles Arrowby is a London theatre director who has recently retired to a seaside cottage in the south of England. He plans to write his memoirs, with particular focus on his lover-mentor, a woman named Clement. The book is written in the first person; Charles chronicles both day-to-day living in his cottage, and describes his life and loves. Vanity and jealousy are central themes. Charles spent his life immersed in theatre, entangled in complex relationships. His cousin James grew up in a more privileged environment and was a perennial cause of envy. Hartley was Charles' childhood sweetheart and, having been rejected by her as a young adult, Charles has been unable to deeply love anyone else. He toys with the affections of two actresses, Lizzie and Rosina, and fancies himself as having power over them when in fact, it is exactly the reverse. 
The plot thickens when Charles meets up with Hartley, who surprisingly lives in the village near his cottage. She is married, with an adult son. But this does not stop Charles from pursuing her, and trying to re-create the happiness he felt as a teenager. Meanwhile James, Rosina, Lizzie, and others make frequent visits and try to talk sense into Charles. As Mary Kinzie writes in her introduction to the Penguin classic edition, Charles ""violently and bullheadedly persists in all the wrong directions."" None of his plans work out as he hopes. And as these plans unravel, he keeps trying to find another way to achieve his dreams. A climax of sorts occurs about 100 pages before the end, in which Peregrine, a theatre friend, calls him on his negative and manipulative behaviors: ""You're an exploded myth. And you still think you're Genghis Khan! Laissez-moi rire. I can't think why I let you haunt me all these years. ... You never did anything for mankind, you never did anything for anybody except yourself."" (p. 395)
Despite these character traits, Charles is not completely despicable. Iris Murdoch had a tremendous talent for portraying the middle-aged to older man and all his foibles, in a way that made the man mostly likeable.

135,"After reading this account of his early life, it is a wonder Augusten Burroughs survived to write the story. If you ever get the chance to see him at a reading, go see him. He is wonderful in person, very candid about any aspect of his previous life.
Since I'm not much of a biography reader, I don't have much to compare this to. From a reader's perspective, the story is very well written and flows of the pages nicely. It is almost as if Burroughs is narrating just to you, the reader. I have not come across another autobiography that reads this easily.
It is his personal history, however, that really makes you sit up and take notice. It is like a real life version of the Lemony Snickett series.

136,"When I heard about this book I was pretty excited about reading it, specially because it seemed to be a completely different book. I wasn't wrong, the book is different. I mean, It's about a girl who feels the dead, the killers and the bodies. The name of the book is great...she is a body finder, so it fits perfectly... There isn't any kind of supernatural character, and everything is ""realistic"" in some way. But, I didn't see the story well developed. Everything was extremely predictable, and too easy. 
Caution SOME SPOILERS
Ok, the story began with Violet (I like her name) who is a girl who feels vibrations when she is near to a dead body, and when is near to a killer o someone who have killed someone o an animal. She is feeling attracted to her best friend Jay, who is not a werewolf or a vampire or an angel. He is a normal boy, who is also in love with her, but they don't know it. Their relationship was really sweet... maybe too much. They are already in love when the story starts, so there is not too much change or progress in that part. 
There is someone who is kidnapping girls, and logically Violet will end up involved with the dead girls and the serial killer. This part also was predictable, like for example...
SPOILER when you find out that there are two killers instead of one. That the second killer is the cop she saw before. That the second killer wants to eliminate her....END OF SPOILER
 
Right know I can't remember any part of the book I didn't see so predictable. The idea was good, but the writer didn't put so much attention. It seems she wanted to finish the book quickly. She could have written something more elaborated.
Something I liked : Her family. Everybody knows about her special talent, and accept her. I really enjoyed this part.

142,"It doesn't seem to matter how adamant I am about the subject matter that I just don't like, there just always seems to be ""that book"" that comes along and shoots all my prejudices out of the water. THE EDGE OF MADNESS is about cyber-war. The threat of annihilation of the free world at the hand of a shadowy threat, hiding behind computer terminals, in darkened rooms, hidden deep in the new Big Bad Evil nation. The nameless, faceless, threat - as the blurb of this book puts it ""no guns, no missiles, no vapour trails stretching like accusing fingers across the skies"".
THE EDGE OF MADNESS sees an unlikely gathering deep in the wilds of Scotland. The location where the Prime Minister of Britain pulls together the leaders of Russia and the United States when Britain realises that there is a massive cyber-attack being rolled out against all of them. Sending nuclear reactors into meltdown, crippling financial markets, playing with military hardware guidance systems, deep inside medical systems; the threat is all the more terrifying as it is completely faceless, completely silent and seemingly impossible to find or track. There is only this small, highly secretive gathering of these world leaders and their closest advisors between shut-down and survival.
As is the way with these sorts of thrillers it seems to come down to one man to save the day. In this case, Harry Jones - SAS-trained, resourceful, unorthodox, man on the spot. 
It's a really interesting premise that's propounded in this book - cyber-attack, one rogue nation (in this case China) against the once unlikely partnership of Britain, Russia and the USA. The scenario is really good - and the evil (in the person of one Chinese General) is ramped right up to the maximum; the good guys hampered by their own petty squabbles and rats in all their ranks. Possibly what is best about the entire nature of the ""threat"" in this book is that it all seems feasible, even possible. Somehow you can sort of see this one working as the author as laid it out. And that's from somebody who normally finds these sorts of cyber-threat books cause more groans and eye-rolling per page than just about any other sort of thriller.
Unfortunately, the early promise in THE EDGE OF DARKNESS fizzled out rapidly at the end. It was always really really difficult to see how Harry was going to stop this particular evil, deep inside an impenetrable nation, but when the resolution sort of all fudged into a cloud of confusion and fires and rushing around in Scotland, whilst seemingly unconnected events in China sorted everything else out, it was disappointing to say the least.

An orphaned English boy with large spectacles, a mismatched foster family, and an adult wizard/mentor combine to make it seem as if Jones has joined the Cult of Potter. After the death of his ""Gran,"" Aidan Cain feels supernatural forces aligning against him. With only the name Jocelyn Brand and a location of Melstone House to go on, Aidan runs away from his foster parents to find protection from threatening specters. Unfortunately Jocelyn is dead and his grandson, Andrew Hope, is a reluctant ""occultist,"" unsure of his powers and how to protect the ""field of care"" that he has inherited. Andrew's inheritance is under attack by a neighboring wizard who wishes to expand his own domain. Confusion reigns, with doppelganger characters, a mostly vegetarian giant, and a were-dog who morphs into a boy (accounting for his powers of speech and thought). There are too many adults in the early pages of the book, crowding Aiden. The appearance of Oberon, the Fairy King; his servant, Puck; and his consort, Titania, on a Midsummer Night acknowledges earlier myth, but these characters seem ill fitted to the Roald Dahl-like writing that is Jones's stock-in-trade.

David Farley and his wife move to Calcata, a tiny, ancient town that's near Rome but is really a place that exists in another time and dimension. Farley is ostensibly searching for Calcata's claim to fame: the stolen relic known as the holy foreskin--the petrified penile leftovers of the one and only holy redeemer.
""Curiosity"" takes a leisurely trip through the centuries, teaching a bit about the medieval relic trade, and the various popes, kings and nobles who spent waaaay too much time obsessed by such things. The history is breezy and fascinating, as is the cast of characters in this utterly bizarre little town. Farley's trips to the Vatican library, his skuldugerous investigations, and his mostly unsatisfactory interviews with the various players in the relic's disappearance make this truly weird quest impossible to resist.

151,"Moloka'i is a well done historical novel, with lots of information about Hawaii and world events from the 1890's to 1970. But most of all it is a beautifully written fictional biography, and that's where it rises from a good novel to a great piece of literature.
Rachel Kalama lives with her loving family until she is diagnosed with Leprosy at age seven. Then, given the laws of the day, she is forcibly removed from her home and isolated in the leper colony on Moloka'i.
It would be easy at this point to expect a grim story, envisioning the horrors of leper colonies in places like India. But Molok'ai surprises. This is a richly drawn saga of a community of people who struggle with adversity like most of humanity, and manage to carve out a life for themselves.
Though the author uses an omniscient point of view, which is typically distant, that is not the case with this book. The reader is taken deep into the hearts of many wonderful characters from Sister Catherine, who spends her life serving the lepers while questioning a god who would create such a disease, to Haleola, a traditional Hawaiian Kahuna, who has one foot in ancient gods, healing and tradition, and another in the emerging modern world. But the character readers will fall in love with is Rachel. Ripped from her family at an early age and experiencing loss and tragedy that would sink most of us, Rachel manages to live a full life and, despite all her trials, keep hope alive.
It would be easy for a story like this to be maudlin, but it is not. It is told in simple but beautiful language in an almost matter-of-fact way that is nevertheless deeply moving. Moloka'i is a well written saga that is at times sad, funny, tragic and uplifting--and in totality, a story about the triumph of the human spirit.

154,"One of those books that make you wonder if you'd be able to do even half as much. After being arrested by the Russians for being Polish (and that's pretty much the sum of evidence we're presented with) the author is tortured and sentenced to 25 years hard labour in a work camp in Siberia. The prisoners are treated very harshly on their journey to the camp, and the conditions barely improve once at the camp. There a sequence of events leads him and 6 comrades to attempt an escape. They set out in winter and head south. A long way south. To India, in fact. 
It's told in a very matter of fact way, with the hardships described in quite spare detail. And it does get a little emotional at several stages along the way. At times you wonder can it be real, as they manage to survive thngs that seem to be quite unendurable. And it makes you wonder what you'd do when put in that situation - is the faint sniff of the chance of liberty worth risking everything for when all you have to look forward to is a long hard death? Maybe.
There is debate as to how true this is, or if the author actually experienced any of it. There are reports of other prisoners walking to freedom, in which case, this can easily stand a a memorial to all that tried, regardless of if they suceeded or not. 
The only thing that I found was that the book ends quite abruptly, and you are left wanting to know more about how these men survived in society thereafter.

164,"This review is from Advance Uncorrected Proofs of The End of East by Jen Sookfong Lee.
I read the first part of this book with a bit of an attitude - it seemed like a rehash of so many other novels about Asian-Canadian or Asian-American mother - daughter angst. It did get a bit more interesting in the second half or so. 
The author weaves back and forth in time,briefly to China, then to the arrival in Vancouver BC of Seid Quan, the elder male of the story. He leaves his pregnant wife, Shew Lin, when he immigrates to Canada. He returns to his wife in China twice, long enough to father a child each time. Eventually, he makes enough money to bring his son, Pon Man, then Shew Lin to Canada. By then the daughters are grown and living elsewhere. 
The main part of the story centers on Sammy, the youngest daughter of Pon Man. I found the story of the grandfather much more interesting, but I thought Lee whipped through it too fast. The survival struggles, the racism, the loneliness and then the conflict between father and son were much more intriguing to me than the conflicts between mother and daughter or mother and daughter-in-law.

166,"Hey guys and gals!
When I first started reading Lacrimosa, it was weird at first because of the style of writing.
BUT, as the story unfolds, I totally saw the need of that type of writing style. It is absolutely perfect for the story line and I love the way Nesy (The Main Character) plays her role in the book.
Expect Warrior Sentinels of Angels, expect suspense at every single page and expect the beautiful love story of Aydan and Nesy to unfold.
I love the way the story was told in different perspective and making the angels sound and look human too.
It was definitely a thrilling ride and the sudden shocking ending at the end really really made me want to know what happens in the next book.
I feel so sad at the end but if you really want to find out what this book is about, you gotta read it.
Its Seriously Damn Good. Period.
Sincerely,
Selina. :D

Amy Nelson-Barak is back and better, and maybe a little crazier, than ever!
When we last left Amy, she had traveled all the way to Israel for her summer vacation with her dad, arriving with very low expectations, only to come back with a whole new appreciation for her religion and culture. Now, Amy is back in Chicago, living with her mother in the suburbs and her mother's new husband.
After her trip to Israel, Amy feels like a totally new person. She's beginning to embrace her religion and her father, she has her very own dog, Mutt, and a non-boyfriend, Avi, who is unfortunately in military training back in Israel. Unfortunately, this new Amy still has her drama and fair share of problems.
Like how her mother just dropped the bomb that she and her husband, who by the way isn't too fond of dogs, are going to have a baby. Then there's that new guy in her building, Nathan, who for some unknown reason totally hates Amy and only sees her as this superficial Barbie. If only Amy didn't have this weird attraction toward him. Her friend, Jess, is having major problems with her new boyfriend, who is also Amy's ex-boyfriend, and her dad is becoming too wrapped up in his work, making it seem like he will be lonely forever.
But can Amy deal with all of these problems without causing even more trouble? Or will her attempts at resolving these issues spiral out of control, making it worse for her relationship with a certain non-boyfriend who just might show up to surprise her?
Sequels do not usually live up to the first book, but HOW TO RUIN MY TEENAGE LIFE certainly did. You just can't help but fall in love with Amy and laugh at her crazy attempts to solve her problems. Her relationship with her father is absolutely adorable, one that anyone would want to have, and the way she embraces her religion just makes us think how we should be proud of ours, as well. Exercising your mouth muscles is a must before reading this novel, since there will be a smile on your face throughout the entire book. Fans of the first book (HOW TO RUIN A SUMMER VACATION) will not be disappointed with this wonderful follow-up.

172,"When first reading the synopsis of this book I was intrigued, the idea of fate pulling two people together, people seemingly impossible to fall for loves tricks, well obviously, thats right up my alley! I was eager to dive into this one, and not at all disappointed once I started reading.
Wolters did a superb job showing the emotion, the unexplainable connection between Maggie and Michael. The characters feeling the strange sensations they both feared to ever feel, yet not being able to deny its existence, was very well described. You could sense the rush, confusion, fear and hope in the wave of their meeting. And from there, you couldnt help rooting for love to triumph fear, and to crush Raffertys twisted hopes for his relationship with Maggie.
I was so pulled into this story I had to keep turning the pages. Just as I was about to cheer that love would survive, I saw how many pages were left and braced myself for heartache. In one turn after another love was at your fingertips, and then pulled away, then within reach again. It was a thrilling ride Maggie and Michaels whirlwind relationship took me on. So much so that I finished the book in one day. Yes, neglecting everything I had on the to-do list, I plopped my kids in front of the TV and put a movie on for them  I just had to see how this ended. 
I could easily connect with these characters, getting wrapped up in their every emotion came easy, and I cant even quite say why. Which right there, is a sign of solid writing. They were real characters; flawed, broken, hopeful and scared. Much like we all have been at some point in our life. 
The ending held a few surprises in it, and I wont indulge you with whether it left me heartbroken, or embracing the excitement of a happily ever after. I will say however that it held within it many sweet moments. Overall this was an excellent read, and well worth the guilt of making my kids watch TV for an entire afternoon. The way Wolters developed the bond between Maggie and Michael, and the challenges they met to fight or accept love was, wellfor anyone who has seen The Notebook, that feeling  youll find it in this book. If youre a fan of love, a fan of getting sucked into the story of people meant to be together  yet almost pulled apart by circumstance, youll love this book. Wolters masterfully produced one of the best love stories I have read in a very long time.

Laura Brown lives in the U.K. - and unfortunately the U.K. is the first country to establish carbon rationing. Everyone will be expected to reduce their carbon consumption by 60%. Everyone has 200 Carbon Points per month to spend on travel, heat, food, and fun. The 200 Carbon Points are loaded on a card. In order to use anything, you have to swipe your card. If you have enough points - fine. If not, your oven could shut off in the middle of cooking dinner.
People have to choose what is really important.
As tough as the carbon rationing is, the extreme weather patterns are worse. Unbearable heat, droughts, hurricanes, and floods put normal life on hold for everyone.
In addition to adapting to this new life, Laura also has to deal with typical teenage issues. Her family seems to be falling apart, her band is attempting to stay together, and she is trying to get the boy next door to notice her.
With the U.K. falling down around her, does Laura have the luxury of being a typical teenager?

180,"First off I want to talk about the cover, I absolutely adore the older covers more than Feehans more modernized cover for Dark Prince. This cover show more sensuality and connection between Raven and Mikail. I have always chosen to listen to Dark Prince, since my local library has most of the Carpathian Series on Audio form, and I prefer it that way. It is read by Juanita Parker, which she has such a great way about her in that she portrays the emotions so well. The story literally comes alive for you as you listen to it. I strongly recommend listening to this in Audio form, you won't regret it.
It starts out with Mikael who has lived hundred of years, and is a Carpathian. Carpathians are very different than vampire although they have similarities, but the big difference is that Carpathians are good, and Vampires are evil and have no soul. Mikael is the prince of his people, who are a dying race, with not many Carpathian women around, and with only sons being born to the women they are literally going extinct. Once during the time of the Crusades, many of their people defended the humans that were being threatened but in doing so many of them were slaughtered, since they become weak during the day. Some of the Carpathians were able to flee and escape. Those included in the slaughterings were Mikael's parents, his father being the leader of his people. Mikael has always taken huge responsibilities on his shoulders. In present day, he is tired and exhausted and wants to seek the sun and end his existence. Without a life-mate, he fears the darkness within him with take over his soul and he will turn into a vampire. He refuses to let that happen. However, when he is feeling desolate, he hears a womanly voice in his head comforting him. He is amazed to find that it is a mortal woman, and he seeks her out. Raven has always had psychic abilities, she comes to the Carpathian Mountains to find peace, she has recently hunted three killers using her psychic ability. She feels drained and at a loss. She is in pain when another touches her physically, and she yearns for solitude and peace among the beautiful Carpathian Mountains. However, hearing Mikaels bleakness she calls out to him, offering aide, knowing she couldn't refuse doing so. Upon talking with Mikael she finds him arrogant and Alpha Male 100% all the way, but she can't refuse him. Upon seeing him, a connection surges between them and neither one of them can resist. Raven is Mikael's life-mate, he starts seeing colors, when for hundreds of years he has only seen in grey. He also starts feeling emotions again, which are clear signs in finding one's life-mate. A journey begins, with Mikael and Raven finding their way, making mistakes along the way, but finding true love and a sensual passion that neither one of them can control or deny.
The Carpathian series, is my up most favorite paranormal series of all time. It always has been since I have started reading from Christine Feehan. The first book I read from her was Dark Challenge, which is my favorite in the series. However, I really have fallen in love with Dark Prince, I have loved reading Mikael and Raven's story. I have fallen in love with both characters. Mikael is typical Alpha Male (Which I love) and he is the leader of his people, and at the beginning of the book is very arrogant and believes everything he says is law. However upon meeting Raven, he finds himself at odds, having met the one person who has no problems with arguing with him, much less a woman. No one ever argues with him, apart from his best friend Gregori who has been at his side since they were young. Raven has lived in solitude most of her life, except when she hunted the killers. But ever since she was little, she has been despised for her gift. Once she comes to the Carpathian Mountains, and meeting Mikael, who is the one person whose touch doesn't cause her pain but pleasure and the likes of which she has never known. It has truly been a pleasure to listen to Dark Prince I can never get bored with Feehan's books I could read her over and over again. I truly loved the characters, the plot and the witty come backs in the conversations, also there was some suspense and mystery has well toward the end, which definitely made it a astounding and enthralling read.

184,"The novel begins with Kathy reminiscing about her time at Hailsham which the reader soon realizes is a boarding school. Kathy brings the reader through her childhood at the school where she met friends, is educated by slightly odd teachers, and prepares for the next stage in her live. As Kathy gets older, she becomes more perceptive of the oddities at Hailsham and begins to question what is really ahead for the school's students. Suddenly, school traditions such as ""the sale"" (in which students sell their work to each other) takes on a completely different meaning as the students realize the Madame of the school is purchasing their work for her own ""Gallery"". Eventually, they realize that their lives are predetermined and Hailsham is just schooling them on becoming ""carers"" and ""donors"".
In the first chapter, Kathy mentions that she's a carer for those who are donors. It is clear that the donor is a person who donates their organs and their carer is just that, a person who cares for the donor. The narration then seems to follow Kathy's train of thought. I was nervous because this is usually an interesting though confusing narration style. However, her train of thought stays on the logical tracks and moves fairly chronologically. Whatever preconceptions I had of this narrative style, flew out the window as I devoured page after page without looking up for hours. As I was reading, I thought the ideas in the novel were incredible and though I had heard of such a scenario in a book before it still felt fresh and new. Yet, once I finished it and started to think about the great issue in the book it started to seem a bit hackneyed. The writing is beautiful and reminiscent of Margaret Atwood but nothing extraordinary.

232 pages.
Appetizer: While walking on the Yale campus, Jack Perdu was hit by a car. While his injuries weren't too serious, he can now see the ghosts that haunt the world at night. When his dad sends him to New York City to see a doctor friend, Jack is led by a strange girl deeper and deeper down into Grand Central Station and into the land of the dead.
After receiving this unexpected opportunity, Jack seeks out his dead mom, who his father refused to speak about. But Jack's situation grows complicated when he grows attached to his New York City ghost guide, Euri, and learns that he can only stay in the realm of the dead for three nights and that the three headed dog, Cerberus hunts him.
I actually had a lot of trouble getting into this book. A LOT. Jack was just a bit too smart for my tastes. He doesn't come across that way in the narration, exactly. But as I was reading, I imagined what I would think of him if I sat down next to this guy in a class or at a train station:
JACK: I'm helping a Yale professor translate Ovid's Metamorphoses from Latin.
JACK: Because I understand Latin.
JACK: And I'm a high school freshman.
SHEL: ....
JACK: And I can randomly quote from other works of poetry and literature, classic and modern.
SHEL: ....
JACK: Would you like to hear a quote now?
SHEL: ....
JACK: My jacket is tweedy. Would you like to touch it?
SHEL STANDS AND MOVES TO ANOTHER SEAT AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS JACKASS AS POSSIBLE.
Basically, I'd find Jack annoying while also being secretly jealous that he was so much smarter than me. The jackass!
My other problem was that he was clearly going through some very tense and emotional situations, but I didn't feel any real emotion coming from him until the veeeeeeeeery ending.
Following along this line, I also had some trouble with the plot. I wanted to feel a sense of urgency. I wanted to care. Really I did. Knowing Jack can only stay in the ghosty New York City for three nights should have instantly caused tensions. But the fact that Euri and Jack spend most of their nights touring the city, sledding and attending plays (granted, the play attending is meant to lead them to some people who could help them or to provide some intertextuality), I felt almost no urgency. That left me feeling ""meh"" about the whole book.
Perhaps it's me. I do know of a middle grade teacher who strongly recommended this book. In comparison to the Percy Jackson series, which is also incorporates Greek mythology, this book emphasizes characters' emotions rather than a fast-paced plot, which will appeal to a more YA audience. Maybe. Plus, it is worth noting that this book really focuses on death, letting go and suicide.
Perhaps I'm just grouchy. I read this book as part of my research for Dudley the Dissertation. (And because of that, I will also be going on to read the sequel, The Twilight Prisoner.) Right now, Dudley and I are fighting, so I could be taking that out on The Night Tourist. 
Could be. But not likely.
Dinner Conversation:
""It was just after dusk when the accident happened. As usual, Jack Perdu was walking through the Yale University campus with his nose buried in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Although he was only in the ninth grade, he had an after-school job helping the head of the university's Classics department on her new English translation. It was the day after Christmas so there were no professors around, which meant there was no reason for Jack to look up out of his book"" (p. 3).
""The next thing he knew, there was a loud, heavy metal music, and he was knocked off his feet and into the air.
Jack barely had time to register what had happened. He caught a glimpse of the car that hit him, heard panicked shouts, and closed his eyes as his body hit the ground. A loud rushing sound filled his ears. Then he blacked out"" (p. 6).
""Jack thought about his accident, how it had led him to New York, and to Euri. Maybe following her to track 61 hadn't been a mistake. Maybe it was meant to happen, so he could find his mother. For the first time in years he allowed himself to imagine seeing her again, and his chest tightened. He took a deep breath. ""Do you think I could find her?"" (p. 51).

191,"Beginning in 1983, PC-Write was distributed as shareware by its creator, Bob Wallace. In fact, PC-Write was one of the first three widely popular software products sold via the shareware marketing method. (The other two programs were PC-Talk, a communications program, by Andrew Fluegelman and PC-File, a database management program, by Jim Knopf, also known as Jim Button.)
This manual is both a tutorial and a user's guide for PC-Write, Version 3.03 for DOS. The tutorial is contained in a relatively short chapter of 19 pages and consists of 14 lessons: (1) Making a Working Diskette or Directory, (2) Creating a File, (3) Entering Text, (4) Saving and Exiting, (5) Loading an Existing File, (6) Moving Around the Screen, (7) More About Entering Text, (8) Changing Text, (9) More Ways to Change Text, (10) Changing Margins, (11) Copying, Moving, and Deleting Text, (12) Finding and Replacing, (13) Help Screens, Reminder Lines, and Menus, and (14) Printing. The tutorial is conveniently summarized in a one-page abstract.
The pages that follow cover these topics in greater detail and introduce the reader to the advanced features and capabilities of PC-Write, such as, managing files, editing boxes and blocks of text, checking your spelling, formatting text and pages, working with columns, merging files, and customizing PC-Write.
PC-Write uses embedded control characters and special function keys to perform various editing and printing operations. A configuration file allows customization of the program. Editing and printing are done by two separate programs that can be run in stand-alone mode from the command line or from the PC-Write menu.
As a programmer, I really like PC-Write because it is first and foremost a text editor. I like using the editor to write programs. If a program generates a report, I can embed PC-Write configuration codes into the output file, save it as a text file, then print the report with my PC-Write print program.
If a user is already familiar with WordStar's one-key and two-key control sequences, PC-Write is especially easy to use. All WordStar cursor actions and block actions are replicated in PC-Write.
Even though Quicksoft went out of business in 1993, I am still a satisfied user of PC-Write Version 3.03 for DOS. It runs just fine on my Windows XP machine in a DOS emulation window. ",0,1224028800.0,7636528,[],MrJack,5.0,"Oct 15, 2008",18911,424429,2008-10-15,2008,10,0.0,0.0,2.5
192,"In this Modern Fantasy tale, a young girl rescues a runt pig from death. Her father sells the pig to her uncle and visits the pig daily. The pig, Wilbur, worries about being killed but finds a spider friend named Charlotte who devises a plan to save his life. Charlotte begins writing positive messages about Wilbur in her spider webs. Word about these messages spread and people come from all around to see this miracle about the pig and spider. Wilbur is taken to the county fair where he does well and Charlotte writes messages there that draws attention from the fair goers. Through this Wilbur and Charlotte develop a strong friendship and when Charlotte dies, Wilbur is left to raise her children. This is a timeless tale about friendship and enduring love.
I have always enjoyed this story about Fern, Wilbur and Charlotte. As a farm girl, I could relate to how Fern felt about killing the runts of the litter and was passionate about that myself. I also could relate to having animals at the county fair and some of the weird and mysterious things that would occur at these events. I introduced this story to my children with the movie and they love this story as well.
I would read this story to my students at the beginning of the school year and have them identify the various types of farm animals. Next, I would take them to the local county fair and have them observe these animals and think about how Wilbur would have been at one of these events. I would also arrange for them to visit a local farm to see the farm animals in their natural setting. Another thing a teacher could do is set up a word wall with this book.

195,"I was intrigued by the premise of this book: an enormous survey provides information about all aspects of relationships, giving us a sense of what normal is. And the book lived up to the concept, more or less. There are all sorts of interesting nuggets here, and it was a relatively quick and enjoyable read. Theres nothing really groundbreaking, but the material is certainly interesting enough on its own. Topics range from romance to communication to money to sex, with enough detail about that last one that I wouldnt recommend the book to the prudish: youll learn, for example, that 52% of women swallow semen when performing oral sex.
I did have some concerns about the reliability of the data and the degree of analysis, though. There isnt really much analysis to speak of; this is more a collection of x percent of people said this, and y percent of people said that. There were times when it might have been just as enlightening to see a straight-up table of results. The book is filled out by personal anecdotes from the survey subjects and various pieces of advice for improving our own relationships, sometimes offered up in an overly chipper tone. Some of the advice is good, but again, it wasnt groundbreaking.
I was also a bit worried about the methodology, which is described in an appendix at the end of the book. All the data is based on a voluntary survey, where participants have a choice about which two topics they answer questions about. There are some core questions that everyone answers, but in general, the responses about family are from people who specifically chose to do questions about family, while the responses about sex are from people who specifically chose to do questions about sex. As the authors acknowledge, this means that the results are neither representative nor unbiased. They dismiss this an unimportant, with the arguments that a) its becoming harder and harder to get a truly random sampling; and b) its okay that the respondents are particularly interested in the quality of their relationships, because the books readers are like that too. I wasnt entirely convinced.
Despite these flaws, I did enjoy the book as I was reading it. It didnt take me long to finish, and I wasnt bored. Im just not sure how much important information I really took away from it in the end. If youre interested in the topic, Id cautiously recommend it, if only because I dont know of any similar book to suggest as a substitute.

200,"I actually thought this was a little disappointing. Pratchett's writing and humour were still decent (though not his best) but the plotting seemed loose even for a Discworld novel. Not to mention it felt like there was a very good novel trying to get out but weighed down by too much extraneous fluff. The plotline about the gods is good and ripe for Pratchett's usual satire. However adding on the Christmas / Hogswatch element seemed, to me, to add another layer to the story that it didn't need. Also, Teatime and the Auditors, although the driving force of this novel, felt rather unnecessary. I believe Pratchett could have written a very similar novel without them and then the story would be a lot more pointed and focused.
So although Hogfather isn't bad, it doesn't sit amongst the really good Discworld novels in my rankings. ",0,1292976000.0,1045100,[],DRFP,2.5,"Dec 22, 2010",6612,17773,2010-12-22,2010,12,0.0,0.0,1.25

204,"Seductive Shadows by Marni Mann
Source: ARC/Author for a fair and honest review
Rating: 5/5 stars
When I got the email asking me if I would be interested in possibly reading and reviewing Seductive Shadows I was instantly drawn to the cover. My only concern after insta-loving the cover was could this book live up to the awesome of the cover. Oh hell yes, is the answer!
Marni Mann and her damn Seductive Shadows had me hooked at page one with Charlie on the train trying to control her intense desire to jump and shag the hot guy sitting across from her. Charlies fantasies are prematurely interrupted by the insistent ringing of her phone and the loud complaints of her dying mother on the other end of the line. As she has for her entire life, Charlie sets aside her needs, wishes, and desires in order to care for her mother, a woman who really cant die soon enough. (Read the book dear reader and you will hate Lilly too.) 
Up until she was a senior in high school, Charlie pretty much managed life with Lilly because of her best and only friend Emma Hunt. Emma was from a wealthy family who all but took Charlie in and raised her as their own. Charlie could manage her awful home life as long as she had Emma but all that changed the day Emma was killed in a horrific car accident. Because Charlie was driving, Emmas family turned on her completely and for five long years, it has been Charlie alone dealing with her mother. In order to cope, Charlie works nights at a hotel, she takes art classes during the day and when the need arises (and it does frequently) she indulges her sexual desires. Everything changes one night when Charlie is approached at work by a woman who inexplicably knows about Charlies particular proclivities and her desperate situation at home. The woman offers Charlie an opportunity she cannot refuse.
Several nights a week Charlie is escorted to a mansion where she is dressed and prepared for the man who has purchased her services for the evening. The money is fantastic, Charlie is cared for medically and emotionally to a certain extent, and she is allowed, albeit anonymously to indulge her darkest phantasies. For a time, this arrangement works well for Charlie, she is able to provide care for her wretched mother and she works far fewer hours which allows her to further her painting skills in class. In fact, one of Charlies professors is so convinced of her talent that he pairs her with a talented and successful local artist for a joint project. Charlie is attracted to her partner, Cameron but doesnt want her night life to intersect with her daytime life.
In all honesty, I thought Mann was going to take this plot line right on through to the end: Charlie would eventually tire of being a high-end hooker, her wretched mother would die and she could be free, her art would take off and she would be able to support herself and she and Cameron would be able to finally acknowledge their attraction for one another and make a go of it. Oh but no, Mann decided to throw a hugely ginormous monkey wrench into the plot that sucked me in even further and kept me up reading even later. Damn you, Marni Mann, damn you!! And no, dear reader, I am not giving you a single clue as to what the monkey wrench is or may involve. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!
The Bottom Line: I was hooked on this book from the moment I saw the cover and when I turned the first few pages I was a total and complete goner and couldnt put this book down to save my life. Despite all the really bad choices Charlie makes I understand her decisions are based on her deplorable circumstances and can therefore completely understand her reasons for making those choices. By the end, Charlie becomes a most unlikely kind of hero and one I truly wanted to see succeed. As to the rest of the characters, there were a few I really liked (Cameron, Dallas, and Professor Emerson) and a few I truly hated (Lilly, the Doctor, and Hunter). BUT, everyone has a part to play and no matter my feelings for them, their parts were well played. As to the plot: the initial premise was enough to make me happy but the added twists and turns, even the truly sick twists and turns, took everything up a notch or two or three. The sex scenes were plentiful and deliciously detailed and nothing was gratuitous, a quality I very much despise in books. Overall, I can heartily recommend this read to adult readers with an interest in erotica mixed with suspense. Due to the graphic nature of this read and sexual content, I cannot recommend this read to readers below the age of 18.

205,"Einstein 1905 is a good book for the layman interested in understanding Einstein's miraculous year of 1905 when he produced five papers, over six months, that profoundly affected the course of science. Taking the papers one at a time, Rigden first sets the context of the issues involved, the questions or conflicts unresolved in physics, then he describes the essence of the paper itself, and outlines responses to it. The papers are:
March: the particle theory of light, which flew completely in the face of conventional wisdom that saw light as a wave.
April: Einstein's PhD dissertation on determination of molecular dimensions in liquids which provided support for the atomic theory of matter.
May: Einstein wanted to develop a theory of Brownian motion that would expose the atomic nature of liquids and that could be tested experimentally; the paper proved the existence of atoms.
June: the special theory of relativity that joined space and time: ""The results of Part I are intellectually and emotionally stunning. Absolute space and time, the foundations of Newtonian physics, are seen to be a figment of our imagination. Absolute simultaneity is also a myth.""
September: a very short (3 pages) paper that produced the famous E=mc2 that linked mass and energy through the speed of light. As Rigden puts it: ""Humans distinguish between energy and mass, but Nature does not. Even more, humans have made mass into something very different from energy. ... If, however, the objective is to describe Nature accurately, humans must accept Nature on its terms and find a way to rationalize the difference between our concept of mass and our concept of energy. The factor c2 does this. Multiply m by c2, and, de facto, energy and mass become what Nature deems them to be: one and the same.""
Rigden also briefly summarizes other seminal papers that Einstein produced by himself or with colleagues, dealing with the equivalence principle (uniform gravitation cannot be distinguished from uniform acceleration; and gravitational mass and inertial mass are one and the same.); his work that anticipated the development of the laser; and work that showed ""spooky"" action at a distance between matched pairs of photons that are said to be ""entangled"" (a term coined by Schrodinger in 1935). 
But the jewel in the crown is Einstein's general theory of relativity, produced in 1916 in which ""The concepts of space, time and gravitation are dramatically changed...the general theory of relativity has replaced the gravitation force, as described by Newtonian physics, with warped spacetime"". This paper, according to Ridgen, is considered by many to be ""the greatest monument to abstract thought"" ever produced by a human being. 
This is not a biography of Einstein. It focuses solely on the papers as described. But throughout, Rigden brings out the marvel of Einstein's thought processes, and his unwavering conviction that his predictions were right (as they were invariably proven to be) because the theories were right. Rigden touches on the fact that Einstein could never accept the basic tenets of quantum mechanics and so, after 1927, he ""stood apart"" from the intellectual environment of physics with his focus instead on trying to unify gravitation and electromagnetism.",0,1153785600.0,435697,[],John,4.0,"Jul 25, 2006",12834,324391,2006-07-25,2006,7,0.0,0.0,2.0

207,"I received this book through the Early Reviewers program, and to be honest it is is not the sort of thing I would normally pick up at the bookshop. That said, I did enjoy the book overall. 
Jeffrey writes good well-paced narrative for the most part, and the plot line is certainly unique (Navy SEAL cum Cajun witchdoctor takes on and defeats ultimate evil - you know the sort of thing...). However, the book does not quite hang together in my opinion. What starts well as an atmospheric action thriller set in the East African jungle, with Navy SEALs taking on Al Qaeda insurgents and failing to stop a bloody massacre, gives way to an introspective romance for the middle of the book. This is only saved by the way in which the author delivers snippets of the main character's past living in the Louisiana back woods, and the slow coming together of past and present to explain the wider narrative thread of the book.
The end was a bit of a let down for me. Having made so much of the need to defeat the ultimate evil, the lead up to and final battle itself was given very little time or space to justify it's potential as the end of mankind as we know it. Going through my head was the parallels with the final level of the game 'Doom' and the battle to defeat the boss guy, which took me far more time to conquer - but then I am no Cajun witchdoctor I suppose.

208,"This if one of the Master Musicians series from Oxford University Press.
This biography takes an interesting approach. The chapters alternate between history and musical analysis. So a chapter will detail Chopins early life, and the next chapter will discuss his early compositions during that period. I think thats an effective approach  those readers who are not interested in detailed musical analysis can skip those chapters, and those readers who are interested in the music can use it as a reference.
Of course, no book on Chopin can succeed without dealing with the elephant in the room  his relationship with George Sand. I think this book does an excellent job of reporting the facts that can be verified about their life together without vilifying Sand or even placing blame. Its much better to report the facts and let the readers reach their own conclusion.
Now that I have read it Ill weigh in with my opinion, for whats it worth. Obviously they would not have stayed together as long as they did (9 years?) if each had not gotten something of value from the relationship. The fact that they were probably platonic after the second year means that it wasnt sex that keep them together. Sand mothered Chopin, and he let her. She provided stability and a place of refuge for him. She nursed him back to health several times. She also reinvented her past to suit her own purposes, probably to justify her own actions. Chopin seemed easily manipulated by Sands daughter, who at least provided the immediate reason for the breakup.
But I dont think the facts, as presented in this book, support the idea that Chopin would have lived much longer and written more and better music if he had not lived with Sand. In my opinion the opposite is probably true. She provided some stability in his life during his most productive periods.
So read this biography and make up your own mind already! ",1,1266019200.0,101934,[],samfsmith,4.0,"Feb 13, 2010",72435,7174,2010-02-13,2010,2,0.0,0.0,2.0

She works long hours in a hotel to just make enough for her and her son to survive. One wintry morning, she returns home to find her 3 year old son missing without a trace.
Then the story flashes forward to 2010 and we met Claire. A newsreporter, who seems to have a troubled marriage and a tragic accident in her past that still haunts her.

She becomes very dedicated to unraveling the truth and as she does, she realizes she may somehow be linked to Vera's story.

I enjoy his narrative technique of jumping between character/location for each successive chapter -- it leaves the reader guessing and waiting for that moment when the 3 subplots will intersect (Kaye, Mitch, and Dicken). The first book satisfies that anticipation, while Darwin's Children strangely leaves one plot thread hanging and unconnected (what does ever happen to Dicken and the Shevite he rescues?). Will's inability to adapt to the camp in California is peculiar, since he was the one who had been wanting to go there in the first place. And the idea that the world would embrace the Shevites because of remains found at an archeological dig is simply stretching it... I would have thought his ideas more interesting and provocative had he left things as they were at the end of Darwin's Radio: a confused and unaccepting world struggles to deal with a force of nature that it tries but fails desperately to understand and to control and is left wondering -- where do we go from here.

I admire Collins refusal to coddle the younger reader from the realities of humanitys capacity for cruelty, but I wish shed coddled me a bit! She seemed to have an unerring instinct for which characters I wanted to know more about, proceeded to bring them further to life and then, well, killed them. The last instalment has drawn poor reviews because Katniss, such a strong protagonist, basically gave up (on more than one occasion), but I thought it a likely response; it mirrored her mothers period of depression while, unlike her mother, she never gave up when those in need were in front of her, and action was possible. I think she still warrants a strong female protagonist label, despite the ongoing state of grief in which she had to function.
This series is really something else, when measured against other young adult lit. Its not fluffy, not even slightly; even the passages devoted to clothing and costumes are fraught with purpose. The excitement that Collins provokes due to fast pacing (once more back on form after the slightly glitchy Catching Fire) is only rarely balanced by any comforting or uplifting scene. Its not entirely without humour (Buttercup makes several welcome appearances) though, and that does make a difference in how readable the series has been, and particularly this book.
Dystopian fiction has always been one of my favourite genres, and I am deeply impressed by how brutally and effectively Suzanne Collins has dealt with it. I dont know what shes going to follow with, but Im certainly going to be reading it. ",0,1322438400.0,9279041,[],eleanor_eader,4.0,"Nov 28, 2011",43258,480091,2011-11-28,2011,11,0.0,0.0,2.0

This is the first in a new cozy mystery series with a mathematics theme and has both good and bad points. The main characters, namely Sophie, her boyfriend Bruce, the police detective Virgil, and her girlfriend Ariana, are all believable and adequately written. I feel the characters lacked some depth, but perhaps this will come in future books. Also, the characters were a bit predictable. The plot was interesting with a surprising ending. Occasionally the story did lag a bit, but not enough to encourage me to give up on the book. The writing was fine -- typical of cozy mysteries -- neither poor nor great.
One disappointment was the lack of math. Yes, I'm not typical because I do understand higher mathematics, but I had expected a few references to some math. The only real math mentioned is the fact that Dr. Knowles creates math puzzles for magazines (and based on this a few puzzles are included at that end of the book).

225,"The fourth outing for John Ceepak and Danny Boyle, policemen in the fictional summer resort town of Sea Haven on the New Jersey shore, sees them inveigle their way into an investigation of the apparent suicide of an American soldier who is home on leave from Iraq. Things are not, of course, what they seem to be and Ceepak and Danny battle orchestrated misdirection on a grand scale and, for good measure, a couple of attempts on their lives.
As always the story is narrated by relatively inexperienced Danny Boyle who jumps to the conclusions that readers might jump to, asks the questions that readers might ponder and generally forms a link between the brilliant but reserved John Ceepak and the reader. He does this in a funny, self deprecating way that manages to make him appear less foolish than the offsiders of other famous detectives. Danny has matured a lot since the first book in the series which is evidenced when his partners drunkard father starts causing problems and Danny, realising Ceepak is not able control himself as he normally would, steps in to diffuse the situation.
I did find it a bit easier to spot the culprit in this book than I have done in the past although I hadnt fathomed most of the details provided in the classic dnouement and the plot, as always, threw up a thought-provoking thread or two. Reading between the lines Id guess that Grabenstein has an opinion about Americas war in Iraq but, unlike the couple of vitriolic reviews I found at Amazon, I didnt think the book was trying to portray a particularly anti-war or anti-army stance. Heck Ceepak is a war hero as well as being the best detective in Sea Haven.
I love the way Grabenstein creates pictures of the people and places he writes about. He manages to use just the right amount of detail to enable me to create terrific mental pictures. Reading Hell Hole had me creating a vivid mental image of a public toilet with a gruesomely dead body in it but I guess you cant always have sunlit beaches as a backdrop.
I am a confirmed fan of these books so perhaps not their most objective reviewer. On the other hand I have given up on many series that stopped meeting my expectations and I wouldnt hesitate to do the same again should the situation arise. Happily theres no need to here because Hell Hole as told by Jeff Woodman provides a thoroughly entertaining tale in which, after doing the hard yards, the good guys triumph. I read (and enjoy) plenty of books where that doesnt happen but it is occasionally nice to have things work out the way you wish they would always do in the real world (rating is 3.5)

Then her older sister is brutally murdered in Ireland, and Mac discovers a cryptic and terrified message from Alina, delivered minutes before her death.
So, despite her parents pleas, Mac finds herself in Dublin, determined to convince the garda to reexamine her sisters case or to find the killer herself. What she didnt expect were the things her sister hadnt told her. When she stumbles upon a bookstore and an ally - dangerous, mysterious, and stone cold sexy - Jericho Barrons educates her about her bloodline and the powers that go with it. Turns out, Mac is a sidhe-seer. She has the ability to see through faerie glamour to the truth of the fae underneath (and definitely doesnt like what she sees) - and one of these fae killed her sister, probably for possessing that very same trait.
Now, to avenge her sister and protect herself, Mac must accept this massive shift in her reality, investigate very scary people, and search out ancient Fae relics. Oh, and shell have to learn to kick ass and not to trust anyone - not even the delectable Jericho Barrons, who has his own motivations for keeping Mac alive.
I really enjoyed the first book in this new series by Moning. Mac is such a funny character and Barrons is a total mystery. Unlike the previous series, this one will not present a new couple every book, but will be the ongoing story of Macs battle against the Fae. Ultimately, Moning says, this will still be a romance, but shes taking her time to develop it. Personally, I love the idea, theres more suspense that way, the characters are more duplicitous, and Im sitting here just hoping the good guys win in the end (of course, Im still trying to figure out who the good guys are). I cant wait for more! But I think the year between installments is going to drive me nuts! But knowing how great Karen Marie Moning always is, itll be worth it.

233,"I was a blabbering, foam-flecked, crazy-eyed fan of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. I literally walked around the bookstore where I work carrying a stack of copies with me, challenging myself to sell every copy in my arms before I had to set them down. I carried them to the registers with me and snuck them on every display I could find (they looked funny in Gardening). I accosted fellow booksellers with it, demanding they read it rightthissecond. I pressed that book to peoples chests and told them, Trust me. Just. Trust. Me.
I waited for the sequel. I waited patiently, albeit with a hollowness inside, as if I was quietly starving for more from this series. So, when my advance copy of Catching Fire arrived, you can imagine my histrionics as I opened the envelope.
Oh, Suzanne Collins. Your Highness. May I call you Highness? Weve never met, but if we ever do, I will fall to my knees and wrap my arms tight around your ankle, never letting you leave the room. At least until youve coughed up the third book in the trilogy. As much as I loved The Hunger Games, did I have doubts that Catching Fire could possibly live up to my lofty expectations? Yes, I admit it. I wondered how it was possible to keep up such a frenzied pacesuch a delicate dance of character and action, tenderness and terrorall balanced on a needles point of pitch-perfect world building. Where could Catching Fire possibly take us?
I never could have imagined. Fears of a sophomore slump need not apply. Where Book One conjured images of The Giver sprinkled liberally with reality TV ala Survivor, Catching Fire hit me a little differently. While those elements are certainly still there, I was reminded more of Orson Scott Cards Enders Game and George Orwells 1984. This volume ventures deeper into post-apocalyptic territory and has more emphasis on the Capitol, where its citizens are little more than sheep, pacified by shiny objects and rich foods, while the leaders slam down their fattened fists on the Districts, like a cruel child smashing ants with his thumb. Like Enders Game, things are not always as they seem, and the people of Panem need a hero, even a reluctant, confused, damaged one. The embers of unrest are quickly smothered by omnipresent face of the Capitollike 1984, Big Brother is watching. This novel defies its pagesthere is way more story than the number of pages would seem to allow. It just keeps getting better, and I cant imagine what Ms. Collins has in store for us in Book Three.

243,"I am a huge fan of Amanda Bonilla, and it's really not just her writing that I love. She is one of those authors who is very accessible to readers and I love that about her. But her writing is really awesome too. I really loved the first book in the series, and I really enjoyed the novella (seriously if authors keep putting out these great novellas I'm going to have to rethink my anti-novella stance). So I have been waiting for book two and it finally arrived. I was very curious to see what was going to happen to Darian now that the big battle from book 1 was over.
The plot of the book was not exactly what I was expecting. Shaedes of Gray was very much a book where the plot action based and you had this feeling when you were reading it that the stakes couldn't get any higher. I did not get that feeling from BBS. For me this entire book is so character driven, although there is plenty of action scenes, and when you finally find out what is really going on you realize the stakes are pretty high), but mostly it's so about the characters.
Darian is still finding her way as this new ""changed"" being that the events of book one left her in. She has also found herself in a relationship with Tyler who she does truly love, but after not letting anyone close to her in 100 years there are certainly some growing pains that need to be worked out. It also doesn't help that someone is clearly messing with Tyler's bond to her and it's make their situation all the more tense.
Raif is such a great character, and you really get to see how much Darian loves him. He has become really like family to her, Bonilla refers to him as a brother type love, but he kind of feels like a cross between brother and father type figure. He has done so much for her so of course she wants to do anything she can for him, like help find his daughter. By the time the book ends I love Raif all the more, and I am so glad that Darian has him to lean on.
My one complaint is that I would have loved to actually see more Xander in the book. He is referred to a lot, and has a few scenes, but generally speaking I missed his whole high and mighty routine/trying to convince Darian to be with him.
Overall I really enjoyed the book. Like I said it is super character driven, and you get to meet some new ones along the way, but you also get to know the old ones a lot better. At the end of the book I really felt like the whole theme was about love, and so many different kinds of love are included in this book. And the ending was so bittersweet, it really made me want to know where everyone was going to go from here. If I had to pick I think the first book is still my favorite, but only by a hair, this is a great follow up book and I would recommend it to anyone (but read the first one too!).

247,"Oh my goodness, they certainly did take some liberties with the movie script. A LOT of them. Which I guess in an ironic kind of way is appropriate, considering....
It is one heck of a story--and I suppose I can see why the scriptwriter(s?) made a few of the changes--essentially, most of the really dramatic edge-of-your-seat stuff was complete fabrication. It definitely made for a more dramatic story, but it didn't make it more true to life, unfortunately. Still, I'm glad I saw the movie--it was a good movie--but I'm definitely glad I read the book too, so I know what was fact and what was fiction. Without all the Hollywood drama (again, the irony!) it's still quite the rescue. It reminds me of the Mark Twain quote, Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; truth isn't.

252,"I was motivated by the opening event - as I believe I was intended to be - to want to know how, by the end of the book, Frank Bascombe would answer the question, ""Are you ready to meet your Maker?"" That was the whole premise upon which the novel was stated. (I sensed that that opening was so important to the rest of the book, that I re-read it before going on.) But we were never really given a conclusion, not Frank's nor anyone else's. 
That premise - that promise - was what was going to, I thought, make this a memorable and enlarging experience. What we learned was that you might get cancer, or even get shot, that a certain frictionless quality of personality can ease you through a lot of situations, and that your relationships with your exes and your offspring might be fraught with all kinds of unresolved consequences flowing from what has gone before in some distant past when, to be generous, you might not have known any better and you were doing the best you could. 
Frank has become a guy who works so hard, with such design, to avoid (or to escape from) unguarded, unchoreographed encounters with any person or situation, that he is essentially an ""accidental tourist"" in his own life. That's not to say he's not paying attention - he is in fact hypervigilant, as a million recounted details attest. Perhaps that's the book that was intended, but it wasn't the one I expected.

253,"I generally don't read a lot of contemporary, for whatever reason. I think I'm always afraid that it's going to be very soapy and melodramatic and whiny -- something, I don't know, just a little too much and not really my thing. But like every genre, there's the good and the bad, and I need to realize that I can't be afraid of sampling it from time to time in order to find the good. Because when it's good, it's good. This is good.
In A Little Wanting Song, Cath Crowley was able to really capture not just being a teen, but being a human. Charlie was one of the most real characters I have had the pleasure of reading in some time. She's shy and sort of timid, a bit of a wallflower type, but because this is told in alternating first-person accounts, the reader gets to enjoy the really rich internal voice that Charlie has. She's smart and funny and artistic, and she's also nervous and lonely and a million other things that work together to make her a fully-realized character. She almost ceases to be a ""character"" at all, and becomes someone you can really connect to. And Rose isn't far behind on the Full Character Scale.
Just as much as the characters, I enjoyed Crowley's writing. Her prose was simply beautiful: it was smooth and flowed well in that way that makes it hard to put a book down -- you know you should because it's 2:00am and you have to work in the morning, and as soon as you find a good stopping point, you will put it down, but first, how about one more chapter to see how Charlie reacts to what Rose just did; oh, that's how? Well, we better see how Rose reacts now...Hmm...maybe one more... It's that kind of writing. It just seems effortless, which means there was probably a good deal of effort behind it. There's a lot of relatable humor in both Charlie's and Rose's narration. And even if the voices overlap sometimes, they still remain their own distinct characters; it's almost in the way that good friends sound a little alike, but you can tell them apart -- it's probably part of the reason they are good friends. 
This is a coming of age story, and a friendship story at its finest. Even when it's completely predictable -- and it can be -- it still works. It's thoroughly enjoyable and engrossing, and it's got me rethinking my stance on contemporary fiction. Or at least considering widening my stance on CF. The only real downsides for me -- and really, I was able to set them aside -- were: the bit of predictableness I mentioned ^^. There is a formula to coming of age stories, and this one does use it a bit; also, there is a spot in the middle of the book that, though I don't dislike it, I wonder if all of what happened needed to happen. It seemed not quite forced, but almost. Like action and craziness was needed as a catalyst. As I said, I liked it, but it was a tiny bit jarring to have a ton of stuff suddenly happening in a rush. But these were minor and the rest of the book more than made up for it.
One last thing I want to mention: Charlie writes songs, and some of them are included in the book as a sort of poetry, and at first I was very dubious. I don't always trust great prose writers to write great poetry -- because often, they don't. So I have to give Cath Crowley a bit of a pat on the back, because some of her poetic interludes were really very nice. They stayed in Charlie's tone, they were expressive and lyrical without being too much, and some of them were really affecting.

256,"I spent a week or two reading Firebirds Soaring, a story at a time. I have said about the other Firebirds anthologies that it is a case of some stories I love, some I like, some Im indifferent to and a few I dislike but I really, really liked most of these.
My favourites were Jo Waltons Three Twilight Tales  a beautifully lyrical and rather Patricia McKillip-esque set of vignettes about a village, and Something Worth Doing (by Elizabeth E Wein), about a girl who joins the RAF during WWII under her brothers name. They were both, oh, fantastic; these were the ones I immediately read again.
I was excited to read Court Ship (Sherwood Smith) but although I liked it, both as a story and because it is about the generation after Crown Duel, I felt like it could have been longer. Other stories I particularly liked included Egg Magic by Louise Marley, which had an unusual magic and I empathised with the protagonist, who feels as if she doesnt quite fit in, socially and in her family. There was something very charismatic about the main protagonists in both The Dignity Hes Due (by Carol Emschwilller) and Power and Magic (by Marley Youmans). Even though they both werent necessarily charismatic people, they were alive and vivid (in quite different ways) and the stories were original, kind of compelling..
Flatland by Kara Dalkey was a thought-provoking futuristic story, really interesting. I didnt completely like Ferryman by Margo Lanagan, but there was something about it And I have to mention Nancy Springers authors note, for being surprisingly entertaining.
I do like how each story has an authors note; theyre interesting and give you space to digest each story. Plus, I like hearing about how authors come to write something, the stories behind the stories. I wish novels did that.

This is the deliciously slow-building tale of a wealthy, bereaved daughter placed in the guardianship of her uncle Silas, who has a shady past.

Our heroine begins to alternately fear that a dark conspiracy is afoot, or that she is slowly losing her mind.

258,"I keep changing rating between one and two stars. In the end, I left it at one because although the book was readable, it left me feeling frustrated and lacking.
I guess the problem is with my expectations. As a rule, I don't read other people's reviews before I read the book, so the Genre labels gave me some unrealistic expectations. Because if we ignore that human cloning is possible in book, there is no other element that is in any way futuristic. They even listen to music on tapes. So, don't expect science fiction.
What to expect?
A lot of tension. The main storyteller, Kathy, tells us about her life and there are constant hints that some great break-trough is on the way. So when she finally discovers 'the truth', you don't even notice it. You have already guessed that and you keep expecting something bigger, some great shock. Well, it never happens.
The ending would be sad, but Kathy in her lethargic attached monologue somehow does not let you feel any sorrow or tragedy. Just... Well nothing.

260,"I picked up this book after coming across blogger Jenny Lawson's hysterical ""Copernicus"" essay, about her encounter with a hideous stuffed antique monkey in a thrift shop. The essay was witty and sharp, and I laughed out loud when I read it - something that doesn't often happen. I was looking forward to more of this type of writing in her book, ""Let's Pretend This Never Happened,"" which unfortunately fell short of my expectations. The initial chapters of the book, which describe the author's bizarre childhood in rural Texas, are preciously, self-consciously written, but amusing enough. As the chapters pile up, a pattern begins to develop - Lawson's ""cute"" and amusing writing style begins to intensify into a forced and somewhat desperate attempt to entertain - ""look at me! I'm nutty! I'm different! I'm flawed!"" Once she begins to delve into her adult life - her marriage, her attempts at blogging, making friends and what becomes apparent as some major psychological issues - the books quickly loses its charm, and it becomes obvious that this poor girl has some serious mental health issues. No matter how much she tries to mask it with ""humor"" (which frankly is more sad than funny), there is no covering up the fact that the author needs professional help. The constant stories about her inability to behave herself in social situations quickly become tiresome, and the charming, quirky tales of her childhood give way to maudlin recounts of her hiding in bathrooms and ruining her husband's reputation with his employers. I understand that in the blogging world there is quite a market for this ""flawed loner"" type of stuff, but what is palpable and entertaining in quick daily bytes doesn't work in a book, and the overall effect of ""Let's Pretend This Never Happened"" is a burning desire to email the author a list of psychotherapists. Unfortunately, Lawson isn't witty or mature enough to maintain the level of writing exhibited in ""Copernicus"", and I think I'll take her advice and pretend her book never happened.",0,1356998400.0,11908606,[],mefs,4.0,"Jan 1, 2013",61731,75812,2013-01-01,2013,1,0.0,0.0,2.0

264,"Just a week or so ago I reviewed Motherland, a satirical exploration of parenthood and relationships in upper class Brooklyn. Triburbia is set just across the East River in Manhattan with a near identical premise and unfortunately I didn't enjoy this novel any more than I did the other.
Loosely connected by business, relationships or simply the school run, the men of Triburbia, whose creative professions allow them some flexibility, meet casually over breakfast to discuss film, sports and politics. Beginning with the Sound Engineer (113 North Moore), Greenfield reveals the histories of this group of men that includes a sculptor, a film producer, a writer, a career criminal, and the wives and daughters who share their lives.
With a mixture of first and third person narratives, it's disconcerting to start a chapter with a new character that has no identity except for an address and a profession. I was never entirely sure who was speaking, surprised once or twice to find it was a wife or even a daughter interjecting into the narrative. More properly a series of vignettes rather than a novel Triburbia has a disjointed feel, with no sure direction, though Greenfield does bring things full circle eventually.
There are one or two characters than inspire some sympathy, the father struggling with doing his best by his autistic son and the man who lost his first love and to his sister for example, but largely these men are shallow and self involved, fretting over real estate values, sex and social status. After the first few introductions, these men - their concerns and their ambitions - are all too similar. While Greenfield's observations may be wryly accurate they lack the insight I hoped for.
The wives are almost uniformly distant from their husbands, busy with work, childcare or in the case of at least one mother, an extensive drug habit. The vignettes that introduce the daughters of these men - the precocious, status aware Cooper and the ambitious Sadie in particular are a more interesting commentary on parenting in the enclave of the affluent.
I was perhaps more interested in the evolution of the Tribeca neighborhood than its residents. A once bohemian community full of shabby artist studios and warehouses the influx of wealthy financial types ordering ""...renovations as vast and grand in scale as the construction of ocean liners..."" ensure Tribeca is home to New York's newest millionaires. Still, a few artists remain like the puppeteer turned repairman (47 Lispenard) one of the lucky few in rent controlled loft spaces who by default is now privy to quality public schools for his children and a social status he cannot afford.
Greenfield, a resident of Tribeca, seems to have mined his own personal background for character inspiration and I suspect that his neighbours may also some recognise themselves within the pages of Triburbia. While I am sure the inhabitants of New York will delight in this portrait of their neighborhood, despite being largely unflattering, I suspect it will have little cultural relevance or interest outside of its environs.

270,"I dont normally read books that are over 1000 pages and after reading Reamde, Im a little reluctant to read something this big again. Not that there was anything wrong with this book; but sitting at over 1100 pages, it was a big task chipping away through this book. Neal Stephenson provides a story full of nerdism, thrills and a lot of action, dipping into aspects of organised crime and terrorism. My first thought of this book was the MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) game that this book is based around; every aspect of this game is covered in this book. It takes all the aspects he liked about World of Warcraft and gave it a face lift, threw out all the parts he didnt like, even going to the extent of making the world geographically accurate for people interested in mining. But the underlining reason for TRain, is the gold farming market; while Blizzard tries to crack down on farming, this game is based around a potential money laundry scheme. While TRain was created for sinister reasons, the creation of the game and the employee of popular fantasy writers turned the game into a huge success. Just reading about this game made me want to play it. This game serves as a background for the main plot in Reamde. 
While there is a lot happening in Reamde, the main plot is centred around a virus, which encrypts files and hold them for ransom for TRain gold. This virus affects a computer containing sensitive documents of the Russian Mob, who do not wish to pay the ransom but set out to hunt down the people behind the virus and make an example of them. Along the way many people become involved including the TRain founder, a TRain employee, some Chinese gold farmers/hackers, a Russian mercenary, a Hungarian hacker, the CIA, MI6 and some international terrorists.
While I enjoyed the ride that Reamde took me on, I cant help thinking that there is a lot of fat that needs to be trimmed. Im not sure if being a bestselling author Neal Stephenson had the freedom to fatten this book up, or the editors didnt do a good job, or they intentionally left the book this long; but I think that this book could haveeasily been turned into a 700-800 page novel without losing any of the plot. While this book was really enjoyable for a nerd like me, I still cant help but wonder; does it need to be this big?

He is the last of his parents' children and they are each determined that he will grow up to take after their side of the family. His father wants him to be a vaquero on the llano as he was and his mother, of farming stock, wants him to become a priest and scholar. And he himself has no idea which way his life will hew, observing everything as he does and asking difficult questions. In her old age, Ultima, a curandera or healer, moves in with his family and becomes a sort of touchstone for him in his philosophical wonderings, not least because little Antonio witnesses great evil that even the local priest seems unable to contain whereas Ultima, called a witch by so many, vanquishes it. As he grows, he reveres Ultima even as she throws some of the things he once thought were fact into question.
Anaya has captured the nature of men and their beliefs in this simple tale juxtaposing evil and good, right and wrong, Catholicism and paganism, child and man. While the novel is very pensive, Antonio as a character is far too old for his years, even if he is a child of the 1940's. His introspection and maturity are simply not that of a 7 or 8 year old child. A novel of ideas more than a novel of action, the plot bumps along slowly from one senseless, violent death to another and interspersed with long periods of tedium. This novel does give a voice to the Chicano population in northern New Mexico and showcases early magical realism and it has some sociological significance as a result. Overall the book was a slow, sometimes mesmerizing read but isn't one that I'd suggest to most readers, knowing they'd be bogged down with the pace.

273,"""Stop pretending I'm going to be all right.""
Sixteen-year-old Tessa is fighting with her family as much as she is fighting her leukaemia. Her devoted father and annoying little brother are giving her cabin fever, her absent mother has recently reappeared in her life, and her only friend left from school is busy living a glamorous life. So Tessa makes a list of things to do before she dies - starting with sex, drugs and petty crime.
Tessa's furious teenage angst is what makes this book excruciatingly real. She could sit around and be a docile patient, but she rails against her father's cotton-wool treatment, her brother's obsession with magic tricks, and her own bad luck. As she sets off about her adventures, she learns a little about responsibility and a lot about growing up. Her determination to lose her virginity results in the inevitable horrendous experience, but she meets a nice boy later who treats her well. Petty crime and a day of saying yes, whatever the question, also end as expected, but the book is more than that - it is an exploration of what it is to be 16, to have your whole life ahead of you - but to not, and to know that Death is standing just behind you.
Downham doesn't dress anything up - Tessa's little brother can be a brat and one day wishes that she die soon and be buried at the dentist; her father cannot bring himself to let her go and spends hours on the internet researching treatments rather than spending time with Tessa. The teenagers are all messed up in teenagery ways and not everything that the reader is hoping will come true does, providing some sad reality in Tessa's environment as well as in her fate.
On the whole, however, it is a positive and beautiful book, embodying a slightly misguided but amusing and eventually fulfilling carpe diem mission.

274,"A primer of the liberal view in politics in America, Eric Alterman does a fairly decent job of providing a nice summary of liberal ideals. Before I get into a discussion of the books content, an idiosyncratic point about the cover 
I hate it! I realize that Alterman probably had nothing to do with its design, but it is a clutter of cartoonish images of liberals. Although I am certain that these individuals are liberals in the truest sense of the word, the hodge-podge smattering of barely recognizable figures saps the intellectual vigor that this book could possess. It is clear the work is directed toward the choir, and the subtitle A Political Handbook for Post-Bush America only reinforces this impression.
As the core of thesis seems to be the notion that America is actually a liberal nation, rather than a conservative one  I would have called the book Were All Liberals and had an image of a blue-colored American map.
Regardless, Alterman does a fantastic job of describing liberalism in the text and clearly argues for the merits of the liberal approach to politics as not only more effective than conservativism, but also as the very nature of the American way of life.
The first part of the book answers the question What is this thing called Liberal? in four chapters. The second part, the meat of the book, discusses the maligning of the Liberal viewpoint by conservatives. Although a great series of chapters that respond point-for-point to the charges leveled against liberals by the right, at times the book falls into the trap of simply repeating the oft-heard complaints against the Bush white house and the neo-conservatives. In other words, at times Alterman offers very little aside from the notion that Liberals are simply not conservatives.
And, as most political pundits, he offers no real solutions to the issues. Given that the subtitle suggests the books is some sort of handbook, it completely lacks any actual advice.
This is a book, as usual, that preaches to the choir. It is unfortunate that the vast majority of people who actually need to read this book, those being consistently duped by the right wing media, are unlikely to ever pick it up.

I really liked this book; it was a lot less morbid than I thought it was going to be. I think that this novel may be geared more towards guys rather than girls because the main character is male, but I really enjoyed it despite that.

Contemporary Romance- Oct. 6th, 2009
4 stars
Paradise Rules demonstrates why Beth Kery is an author to watch out for! In her latest installment, she explores the journey of her heroines transformation, one that includes some very erotic scenes that kept me glued to the pages!
Lana Rodriguez has issues. When you are popular and famous people try to take advantage of you and she has had to learn the hard and painful way to protect herself and her own. When her friend Melanie is devastated by a nasty divorce Lara decides to drag her with her to Hawaii for a vacation. Once there they both decide to take surfing lesson with Jason Koa. A beautiful if arrogant playboy that annoys Lana. The tension between the 2 is powerful. But Lana and Jasons mutual dislike overlays an intense attraction. When Lana decides to boost her friends spirits and have a girls night out she decides to call an escort service for her friend and herself. But when she opens her door she is surprised to find Jason ready to service ALL her needs! She is helpless to stop her addiction to his charms but Jason says they can only continue their affair if she agrees to his rules. 
Jason wants Lara and when he hears that his cousins escort service latest contract is to find Lana a man, he decides to volunteer himself! As Jason pushes Lara, a woman who is used to control, he doesnt realize the powder keg he has opened. Jason is very dominant and protective. Seeing Lanas true vulnerability breaks something inside him. He wants to be the one she turns to, the one to comfort her. But her painful past prevents her from being impulsive or spontaneous. And when the tabloid releases a scandal concerning their escorted relationship they face hard decisions. Is this new relationship something worth holding onto?
Beth Kery excels at hot and sensual scenes. At first I found Lanas character abrasive and Jasons arrogance a bit of a turn off. But as the author slowly built the tension and reveals the vulnerability in her characters I could not stop the pull I felt for the 2! Lanas childhood is scarred and I wondered if she could see through er past of pain. Lana is an intensely private person and she feels comfortable that way. And Jasons very dominant and forceful appearance in her life makes big changes for her. Lana questions her motto to keep men out of her life, but having Jason around makes her feel sooo good. Should she take a chance with Jason? Taking risk with her emotions is difficult for her. She must confront her demons and let a man be there for her when no man has before. 
I really enjoyed the relationship between the 2 characters, especially Lanas transformation. They were a well matched pair that were wonderful together.

286,"This title had been on my TBR pile for quite some time; it just seemed so cute. I thought that it would be a fun, light read to get me through an afternoon.
While I liked this title and really did think that it was cute, I was honestly, a little disappointed. Jane is not the most responsible teenager, even though she has a job, and jobs automatically equal responsibility, right? It is mentioned that she did well in school to the point where she had all her required courses done Junior year, which enables her to take fluff classes for senior year as well as a couple college courses in the afternoons. Awesome, right? Come to find out, she's been skipping all of her classes for weeks and no one has called her on it. Big pet peeve!!! There's also absent parenting!!! Bigger pet peeve!!! Well, her parents are around, ish, but they don't pay attention. I found myself pretty much unable to focus on the bigger picture of the book until the school skipping nonsense was resolved. I'm awesome like that.
The matching people via coffee drinks doesn't majorly come into play until the last third of the novel, and it's just kind of thrown out there in a really random way, after several scenes of instant love. I know the whole premise is setting people up with their perfect match based on the favorite coffee drink, but come on, relationships are about more than coffee. (Example, my significant other doesn't even drink coffee).
While the premise is cute, and there are some genuinely funny lines throughout the novel, it just didn't live up to my expectations. Granted the book is very short, but I was expecting more, oomf. A cute premise, cannot fully make up for a rushed plot and mostly flat characters. While I think some will like this book, due to its length and plot, there was too much that didn't work for me and not enough humor or heart to compensate.",0,1322524800.0,6665816,[],jennladd,4.0,"Nov 29, 2011",51162,402659,2011-11-29,2011,11,0.0,0.0,2.0

293,"Bestselling author Sara Foster presents her third novel, Shallow Breath, a compelling story of loss and love.
After two years of incarceration, Desi Priest is finally free to return home and begin making amends for the impulsive act that destroyed her family. While her long term friend, Pete, welcomes her back with open arms, her teenage daughter, Maya, will barely talk to her, neither her father or he brother, Jackson, can look her in the eye and her best friend, Rebecca, may never be able to forgive her.
Unfolding through multiple perspectives, Shallow Breath moves between the past and the present while roaming over five continents. It's an ambitious range that Sara Foster manages well, building a comprehensive picture of her characters and their passions.
As Desi contemplates her future she recalls her past, her short lived career working with the dolphins of the Atlantis Marine Park, her relationship with Maya's father, Connor, an American marine biologist who was tragically killed before Maya was born, the dreams she gave up to raise her daughter and the tragedy that led to her prison term.
Meanwhile Pete continues to try and protect Desi from some harsh truths, abandoning his own dreams to support, Maya rebels against her mother's concern, and Jackson is distracted by the enigmatic Kate, whose secret has the potential to destroy them all.
The author's passion for animal conservation is a central issue in Shallow Breath, which explores the abuse of kangaroo's, the horrors of dolphin slaughter in Japan, the threats to the orangutan-tan in Sumatra, the diminishing population of whale sharks off the coast of Galapagos Islands and the hunting of elephants in Africa. Though I felt at times the information crowds the story, the information is thought provoking and inspires compassion for these threatened creatures.
One of the settings of the novel that particularly appealed to me was the West Australian town of Two Rocks where the the Atlantis Marine Park once stood. I have fond memories of visiting the attraction regularly as a child and remember well my delight at seeing King Neptune towering over the entrance on our approach. My family moved to New South Wales in 1988 so I wasn't aware that the park was closed just a few years later and I was saddened to learn of it's demise.

Whether his legs are bored with walking or he insists on eating snails when everyone else is going for a swim, he does things his own way. Eventually, his mother and siblings agree that it's not the wrong way - it's just different.
The story is a bit light and a little too heavy-handed in its moral in places, but the real appeal of this picture book is the pictures. The ducklings are adorably fluffy and Rossell has perfectly captured their gawky awkwardness and long legs. Their mother is comfortably fluffy and agreeably indulgent. The soft pastels and delicate details of the ducks and landscape are extremely appealing.

296,"Rybczynski tracks the construction of a neotraditional development -- New Daleville -- on a former corn field in rural Chester County, Pennsylvania. The author drops in broader discussions at opportune points in the story; topics include the history of subdivisions in America, neotraditionalism (or new urbanism, though the term seems wholly inappropriate for this rural location) as an planning and architectural movement, and the stylistic preferences of American homebuyers. As someone with no practical experience of the development process, I found this book a valuable introduction to the different players -- the developer, the architects, the builders, the marketers, the local officials -- and their contrasting agendas. Rybczynski presents the various perspectives even-handedly, giving the various characters the chance (through candid quotations) to speak for themselves. 
Two aspects of the work frustrated me. First, at several points, Rybczynski equates environmentalism with reflexive opposition to development. As an environmentalist who supports sustainable development, I found the casual stereotyping inept and annoying. Second, Rybczynski underplays a striking lesson of his story: that the big national builders' economic model, based on rigorous standardization, is fundamentally incompatible with the neotraditionalist goal of distinct local character. It's clear that the layout of the finished development will be neighborhood-focused, but it's also clear that stylistically, the houses will all look like houses everywhere else. Rybzcynski's postscript is a cop out: ""Developers tread a delicate path. They are agents of change, operating between the regulations -- and desires -- of local jurisdictions and the demands of the marketplace, and they must satisfy both. That isn't always easy, and it's rarely popular."" A more pointed conclusion is that until national builders jettison a one-slate-of-options-fits-all approach and accept narrower profit margins, we won't see true neotraditional development for other than the most expensive neighborhoods. Still, the story is told with enough detail that a reader can draw his or her own lessons, and the ride is illuminating.
Out of curiosity, I've gone searching for updates on the history of New Daleville since this book was published in April 2007. As of late December 2008, I've found only an NPR Morning Edition report from August 22, 2008, noting that home sales in the neighborhood have slowed, with half the lots still unbuilt.

297,"Chester's Mill is a small community of approximately 2,000 residents. One fall day, a dome suddenly encases the entire town. The initial casualties are nothing compared to what is to come. With a series of unfortunate events, a corrupt town hall and the U.S. government unable to provide assistance, a few brave citizens have to find out what's causing the dome, and get rid of it, before they're killed by a used car salesman or the deteriorating environment within the dome.
Under the Dome is an excellent read. I would place it within my top four favorite Stephen King books following 1.)Dark Tower Series, 2.)The Talisman, 3.)The Stand. King's speciality is developing a community of unique characters and then letting the very worst of the bunch seize control. In this book, the ugly side of human nature is more frightening than any supernatural activity. I was drawn into this book and could not put it down.

299,"This is easily one of the best books I've ever read. It's just fucking genius. The writing was phenomenal.
David, a 12 year old boy who loves his books, loses his mother. He gets lost in the world that's slowly evolving around him - there's a great war going on, his father is moving on with his life, and, well he's an angry 12 year old boy. His mother has been taken from him, a usurper is trying to take her place, and he's being replaced with a half sibling. This book is largely about his grief and loss and coming to terms with them.
In the middle of all of this he falls into a fantasy world that is a world made by the minds of those that have come before him, and to some sense, himself. The stories he grew up reading are real, and they're ugly. All of those dark fairy tales (that are all dark if you ignore the Disneyfication) are made even darker, and it's absolutely delicious. There's sex, death, child abuse, torture, power grabs, communist collectives, gluttony... Everything that makes those old folk tales scary... and awesome.
Connolly does a great job of writing a distraught child, that I can personally feel for. David loses his mother at 12. I lost my mother at 11. David's father (in a few months) starts seeing someone who was involved in her caretaking. My father also married one of my dead mother's caretakers. David is bitter and angry and lost at life and having a hard time finding his way, and it was written as real as I remember it being for me. Through the heartbreaking journey, either I sympathized with David too much and got sucked in, or Connolly just wrote it damn well, and it was easy to be sucked in.
The fantasy land was fantastic. It was dark, and it was dangerous. And through it, David grew up, not too much, but enough. There are hints at things just beyond his knowledge that he can't (or won't quite) recognize, but in the end he became a better person for what he went through. He learns he can understands and can accept life's changes.
I love re-imagined fairy/folk tales, and this is easy one of my more favorite books with that element. The blending of the dark tales and the coming of age was wonderful. Definitely not a kid's book, but definitely awesome. ",0,1364688000.0,1107522,[],suzemo,5.0,"Mar 31, 2013",77144,41955,2013-03-31,2013,3,0.0,0.0,2.5

The first story is The Waiting Room, and is my favorite. Without giving it away, the main character is able to help a sad spirit. I thought the ending to be very sweet, and can't help but wonder what happened to the ghost in the end.
The second story is The Forgotten Son. This was my least favorite. It's not a bad story, but I felt that it was too short, it needed more back story. Possibly this one would do better as a novel length book, with more character depth and development.
The third story is the Closed Circle of Friends. I very much liked how the ghost in this one was messing with their heads. I thought it was pretty funny, actually. However, I think jumping between character viewpoints was unnecessary.
All in all, it was definitely worth the read, and a good first novel by a new author. I look forward to seeing more from H.L. Baker. ",0,1365292800.0,13606469,[],Cassandra_Strain,4.0,"Apr 7, 2013",5109,150741,2013-04-07,2013,4,0.0,0.0,2.0

Even though the subject matter is depressing, Mr. Kneale is able to effectively capture the small, humorous, and poignant moments of childhood.

By Terry Pratchett
 Some people end up on all the adventures... it's to bad for Rincewinds that once again he's pulled into adventure. On diskworld there is an eighth color, great wizards are the eighth son of an eighth son... eight is a special number when you are dealing with magic. Wizards and women also don't mix. The why is nether really covered it;s just not done. So when a wild and diferent Wizard becomes astranged from the Unseen University builds a family has seven (wizard) sons then has an eighth things get complicated. 
 When Sorcery is let louse on the world dangerous things happen. Rincewind takes it upon himself to run away. Trying to get as far away as possible only to find he cares and is the only one left to do anything about it. The world may survive (since this is book 5 out of 38 thats a safe guess) even if Rincewind gets stuck in the Dungeon Dimension at of it all. 
 Theres not much to really say about this book... the only question I had is where are the witches will all these wizard towers and magic being brought up from nowhere... I KNOW its not a story about them... but Diskworld is generally very good about covering all the options about people who might be able to have an effect on the situation and this was the first time I really questioned things...

318,"Perfect and Dear, a New Treasure to Add to the Holiday Bookshelf, December 9, 2011
 By Michele Kingery
This review is from: Lighthouse Christmas (Hardcover)
""We both want Christmas, Frances thought. So why did people have to live in lonely places like Ledge Light?""
Frances and her little brother Peter are especially lonely this Christmas. Their mother died in the spring and their father has taken a job transfer, moving their little family from the mainland lighthouse to one ""in the middle of the ocean."" Peter is determined that Christmas will come one way or another and sets out to ""plan"" it with cheerful drawings of his holidays dreams; cookies, carols around Aunt Martha's piano, candy canes and an evergreen tree. Frances doesn't say it, but an empty pantry and a delayed supply boat don't bode well. She carries on, never dashing Peter's hopes, but not overly optimistic either.
I found this book on the NY Times Review page several weeks ago when I was trolling for children's holiday literature. What can I say about this wonderful little story? Nancy Carpenter's illustrations are done with a limited palette that captures a bygone era. Frances, in her cropped hair and white pinafore is the perfect mix of brave and vulnerable. Snuggled up to a chubby, one-eared cat with his crayons and paper, Peter is a little boy so filled with hope and optimism, your heart aches for him.
Writer Toni Buzzeo is to be commended for having just the right touch, taking what could have been a sentimental, overwrought tale and weaving something heartfelt and fresh. A Christmas miracle arrives in the form of a special package dropped from a plane piloted by a ""flying Santa"". A little bit of history about the ""Flying Santa Service"" follows at the end of the book.
""Lighthouse Christmas"" will take its place among my favorites. It is a delight and one I look forward to revisiting each year. To keep or share, ""Lighthouse Christmas"" is a treasure.

But at the same time that he makes the story into an epic, he also picks out some details from histories and documents for interpretation. I liked Michelet's conception of why Joan wore men's clothing - he's thinking about Joan as a person, while he's making her into a mythological character.
Guerard's introduction and conclusion are well-suited to this text, since he makes some unapologetic judgments on the text and Michelet himself.

323,"From my blog Anya @ On Starships and Dragonwings
One of the first things I noticed about Poison by Bridget Zinn was the cover. Ive heard differing opinions, but I loved a cover that told most of the premise and had a heroine that wasnt in an overly sexual pose. Its so difficult to find covers like this on fantasy books! I also loved the depth of the cover, since I kept noticing new aspects to it (totally didnt see the piglet the first time &gt;.&gt;)! Anyway, the cover also reveals the Disney-esque feel to Poison, in that it totally could be the cover to a Disney movie and has a plot line that very much reminded me of a Disney movie. So if you are up for a light-hearted fantasy that doesnt take itself overly seriously, check out Poison.
Note: I bought a copy of Poison to review because I couldnt resist that cover. &gt;.&gt;
Title: Poison
Author: Bridget Zinn
Length: 288 pages (hardcover)
Genre-ish: Light fantasy
Rating:  (4.5)- fun for what it is
Strengths:
There were several times when my neighbors probably got annoyed at me because I laughed long and hard while reading Poison. I just love those witty lines :D.
Poison is not a book that just throws a cute piglet on the cover to be adorable. The pig has a purpose and its a very important one, yey!
Potions! I love the idea of a heroine whose greatest skill is in making and using potions. Freaking awesome.
Poison has a pretty typical magic kingdom world, but there are a few interesting and fun twists.
Weaknesses:
The potion magic system in Poison is quite simplistic and convenient unfortunately.
There is a fair amount of vocabulary you wouldnt expect in fantasy settings, though this fits in with the Disney feel.
Poison starts out all action-packed and cool, but it takes a fair while to explain the actual motivation that Kyra had for trying to assassinate her best friend. It makes sense once its explained, but I was a bit confused for the first part.
Summary:
Poison is great if you want a story that is light-hearted and fun with just enough fantasy elements to make your brain daydream. If you like Disney movies, you will probably like Poison ;-). Just dont expect this to be an epic fantasy adventure since you would be setting yourself up for disappointment. As many of you know, the author of Poison, Bridget Zinn, passed away shortly after finishing Poison, and so there wont be any sequels. I can assure you that Poison wraps up well and doesnt really leave any questions, however I wish that there was the opportunity for deeper development of this world through later books.

332,"wasn't exactly looking forward to reading this book. I read Life As We Knew It and had so-so feelings about it. But I saw it in the library and was looking for something to read, so I really had no excuse not to read it. 
This book was more a companion novel than an actual sequel, and it was based around the same catastrophic event: moon craziness. This time the main character was a 17 yr old Puerto Rican from NYC, named Alex. This book follows his story as he and his two younger sisters struggle to survive. 
The main problem for me was the main character. He is a Puerto Rican from NYC, so why didn't the author make him Puerto Rican? I mean this boy is very pious, being the Vice President of his class at a Catholic school. And the only thing that the author attempted to do to portray his latina heritage was having him say random words in Spanish. Not quite. Hey, I can say random words in Spanish too! Mama mia! Wait--that's Italian...... 
And besides that, the plot was just kind of boring. We get it, you're starving. Point made. Although, I did think the book progressively got better. By the end, I was actually interested. 
I also didn't think there was much difference between The Dead and the Gone and Life As We Knew It. They both were about starving families stuck in their situation, one way or another. Except one was a rural setting and was an urban setting. But the main characters had very similar voices.

Barclay is a master of red herrings and plot twists. This story flips and twists all the way to the very end, leaving a reader unsure of what is coming next. It's a gripping ride and well worth the time. While the plot isn't very plausible, it is entertaining. By keeping things moving at a fast pace and keeping his readers off-balance, Barclay does a good job of creating a sense of urgency.

338,"Climate of Extremes : Global Warming Science they Dont Want you to Know by Patrick Michaels and Robert Balling Jr is the best book Ive read on Climate Science from the skeptics point of view. If you want to understand global warming and want to see what climatologists who disagree with the majority then this is the book to read. Its well written, data heavy and well worth a read for anyone who is interested in climate change.
The book goes through the science of global warming and says that it is extremely likely that temperatures will rise due to Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW). The authors believe that warming will continue at about the same rate as the warming that has occurred since the mid 1970s, at about 0.15C per decade. They talk about the 20th Century warming and point out that the warming pre WWII was likely to have been non-anthropogenic but that the later warming is likely to have been human induced. They make the interesting and rarely reported point that methane has risen and fallen in the atmosphere and the cause is unknown. They point out that James Hansen has stated that he believes warming will be about 1.5 C / century rather than at the higher rates that many AGW proponents have proposed. They point out that the models all have a problem in that at 10km they predict more warming than has occurred and that their daily temperature range projections are wrong. They point out how remarkable it is that it is not common knowledge that the models are overestimating warming and that no model has predicted the 10 years of no warming that has occurred.
The book is the book Ill offer to my AGW proponent friends. This book, together with Bjorn Lomborgs Cool It, give a very good presentation of the skeptics case. Even if people disagree, the case should be heard and understood by those who believe that immediate action is vital. They probably wont change many peoples views, but they will make people realise that skeptics are not crazed total deniers of temperature increase but rather represent a scientific and economic opinion that, whilst it may be wrong, is not a product of ignorance or lack of reason.

Fast-forward two years. Zombies have disappeared but other illnesses, like bubonic plague, leprosy, and others, are out there from the decomposing corpses.

350,"Anita Shreve (author of the much-touted ""The Pilots Wife"") has done the near-impossible in ""The Weight of Water."" She has written two tragic tales, separated by more than 100 years, and coiled them seamlessly into one compelling narrative. This is one of the most emotional, provocative and exciting novels Ive read in a long time. For those who dismissed ""The Pilots Wife"" with a shrug, this is THE Shreve novel to search out at the local bookstore. ""The Weight of Water"" is a much better crafted work than the more recent Oprah pick.
In the novel, a photojournalist named Jean gets an assignment to do a photo essay on a 100-year-old double-murder that happened on the Isles of Shoals, a tiny group of islands off the coast of New Hampshire. Jean brings along her poet husband, her five-year-old daughter, her brother-in-law and his new girlfriend. They all climb aboard an old sailboat and head out for the barren islands. Turmoil brews as quick as afternoon storm clouds. Jean and her husband Thomas have a strained marriage, full of jealousy and stony silences; Rich, Thomas brother, has a physically passionate relationship with his girlfriend, but their relationship also shows signs of trouble when she starts to flirt with Thomas; then theres the volatile relationship between Thomas and Rich. Let's just say, its a far cry from the Love Boat.
Shreve skillfully gets the reader involved in the soap opera when, in the first few pages, Jean and Rich take a trip onto the island to photograph the murder scene. The attraction and tension between them is as palpable as the briny sea air.
Interwoven with the modern story is the saga of what happened on the island in 1873 when two women were brutally murdered with an ax. This part of the novel, told in a memoir by another woman who hid in a cave after the murders, is even more intense than Jeans marital woes. I dont want to spoil any of the delicious narrative surprises Shreve has in store, so Ill just say that theres insanity, jealousy and incest at work on the island in 1873problems that continue to resonate and haunt characters 100 years later.
As she proved in ""The Pilots Wife,"" Shreve has a sure touch when it comes to accurate, detailed descriptions. With an admirable economy of words, she gets us right under the skin of the characters. Heres Jeans lament from the opening pages of the novel: ""Sometimes I think that if it were possible to tell a story often enough to make the hurt ease up, to make the words slide down my arms and away from me like water, I would tell that story a thousand times.""
Fortunately for us, we are given the story and all of its pain and passion.
(As an aside, Shreves descriptions of Smuttynose Island and the rest of the Isles of Shoals were so graphic and interesting, that I immediately searched the Internet for photos of the area. I found one site [though there may be more] that had a collection of beautiful images: http://www.perpublisher.com/shoals.html) ",0,1150675200.0,4725,[],davidabrams,4.0,"Jun 19, 2006",40379,338119,2006-06-19,2006,6,0.0,0.0,2.0

355,"Up until I read my first Susan Edwards book, Summer of the Eagle, I've always disliked western/native american related romances. Not because of the culture or race, but because the few that I had read before I found to be very lacking and boring. But Ms. Edwards writes a fantastic, romantic, and adventurous story that just happens to be set in a western era, in this case the long trail to Oregon, the land of opportunity back then. You'll find yourself pulled right into the story, and you won't be able to put it down until it's over! 
Ericia and James' story is a very touching one, and I found myself sighing with pleasure and even about to wipe away a stray tear or two. Their love is strong, true, and not just based on the sexual things, like some relationships. Don't get me wrong-- the sexual aspect of the love story is important and enjoyable, but it's not everything. Though the love scenes in White Nights are steamy and tender, they also show you the emotions behind their connection. Their love starts out as more of a sweet, pure love and it's a while before they do more than kiss, something that would usually bother me or make the story slow, but in this case, it only adds to the over all goodness of the book. 
Challanges and road blocks create a rocky path for their love to travel on, but they still manage to over come it in the end. White Nights is more than just a book about love, it's also about family and friends, moving on and starting over. Ericia's husband, Birk, is a real bas**d, I'm sorry to say but it's true. He abused her and their small children, he treated her without respect, and he didn't care one bit about any of them. Because of this, both Ericia and the children have been scarred by the father's action, and they are scared and shy, until James shows them that he loves them all and he wants to be part of their family, that he will take care of them forever. The change doesn't happen over night, but watching the children warm up to him and come to call him Papa, along with the charming love story brewing between him and Ericia, makes the story that much better.
Though I wish I had the first couple of books in Ms. Edwards White Series, so that I could have read them in order, it is not necessary to do so. You could go out and pick up this book right now *Though you'd better hope your library has it, since almost all of her books, this one included, have been out of print for a few years now. I was lucky to find most of them at my used bookstore in town.* and you wouldn't be lost. However, you may find yourself becoming interested in the various other character's lives and love stories, some of which have already been written and some that have yet to have their own story, and want to go back and read all of the previous ones right away. I know I do! I'm especially interested in reading Wolf's story, but I haven't been able to find it yet...

359,"Svensson offers a survey of the literature on the history of human rights in China. She takes some stands but is generally synthesizing the work of others. It is broken into thematic chapters. One of the more interesting chapters looks at the argument that Chinese (Confucian) cultural is not compatible with western ideas of human rights. Svennson believes that the cultural argument is more of a rhetorical devise than a legitimate objection. Although many have said that Confucianism doesn't work with western ideals, Svennson dismisses that. She finds the attempt to find Confucian roots for human rights misguided. It's origin should not preclude it from being applicable to China, but the PRC uses terms like cultural imperialism to discredit human rights rhetoric. She argues that all cultures adopt some foreign ideas and make them their own. The foreignness of human rights could only be a temporary issue if the Chinese embrace it.
She also discusses how human rights entered the Chinese vocabulary. It has a spiritual connotation as the literal translation to the most used term (tianfu ren quan) is ""heavenly endowed rights of people"". But that term was not the only one used and only became the consensus in the early 20th century. Other terms about rights go back as far as the Han dynasty, but to call them human rights would be a stretch. Confucian culture acknowledged rights and responsibilities, but with a much greater emphasis on the responsibilities to society and family. Svensson argues that the PRC looks at the responsibilities while dissidents and NGOs look at the rights. She concludes that there is no single Confucian culture to analyze but that it depends on the interpreter. I found that argument very wimpy. The fact that there are different interpretations on history is hardly news. The responsibilities required of Confucianism were always more dominant than the rights. Even with the CCP victory in 1949, responsibilities were still more important. Only the Cultural Revolution was about to weaken their importance. 
Svensson does deal with this later in the book but again not very satisfactorily. That said, this is still a great read if you are interested in the cultural and historical context of human rights in China.

367,"Desires of the Dead is another suspense filled and utterly absorbing novel by Kimberly Derting who is fast becoming one of my all time favourite YA authors for the way she seamlessly weaves mystery and edge of your seat suspense together with romance.
After finishing The Body Finder I was desperate to discover whether or not there was going to be a continuation of Violet and Jays story because quite frankly I fell in love with both of them, so imagine my utter excitement when I found out that there was indeed going to be a sequel and International Book Tours had snagged themselves a copy for a tour which I quickly signed up for. So here I am now writing this review after literally just having finished reading the book.
 
I probably should mention that I had high hopes for Desires of the Dead, and from the moment I read the chilling prologue of things to come I knew it was going to be just as absorbing, I couldnt read through the pages fast enough, I had to know what lead up to the events in the prologue and how it was going to end. I couldnt even put the book down when I was supposed to be studying for my stats exam, thats how engrossed I was in Violets story. Perhaps this book should come with a warning, something like beware once you start reading Desires of the Dead you wont be able to put it down, no matter what else you have to do. 
What I find so engrossing about both The Body Finder and Desires of the Dead is that the whole concept of Violets special ability, which is the primary focus of the book, is so unique, I havent read anything like it before. For those of you who havent read The Body Finder yet (why not?) Violets special ability is best summarised by Kimberly herself 
""The dead called to Violet.
They used echoes that only violet could sense, pulling her onward, steering her to their locations. These echoes came in many forms. Smells, sounds, sometimes an inexplicable color. Anything.
Yet not all the dead had echoes, only those who had died violently, their lives cut short. And it wasnt just the dead who stood out to violet but also those who had killed. They bore a mark as well: an imprint identical to the echo of their victim. - page 12.
It is this special ability that gets the FBI interested in Violet when she is drawn to an echo that she cant get out of her head, it calls to her. The only way for Violet to loose the incessant pull the echo has over her is for the body to be found and laid to rest. In a sudden impulse Violet decides to ring the authorities, tipping off the bodies location which inadvertently brings Violet to the attention of Sara Priest, a specialist who works with the FBI and Rafe a mysterious boy not much older than Violet who works with Sara, however were not sure what exactly his job with Sara involves. It is clear from the start though that these two are hiding something from Violet. Suddenly Violet now has to deal with Sara who has made it clear that she believes Violet has a special ability that she is hiding and Sara wont let it go. This is of particular concern to Violet who has been very protective of her secret all her life, only her immediate family and Jay know of her special ability. 
Violet soon finds herself questioning why she has kept her ability a secret all these years, should she open up to someone else and should that person be Sara or someone else? Who can she really trust? With Saras inquiries Violet also starts to question whether or not she could help others with her ability just like she did previously. 
 
Whilst also trying to deal with the consequences of her actions which involves an ever present Sara Priest and Rafe, Violet also finds herself trying to figure out how to navigate through her new romantic relationship with Jay which doesnt help when a new boy, Mike, and his sister Megan move into town taking up Jays time. It soon becomes apparent that Mike and Megan have secrets of their own, one of which could have dire consequences not just for Mike and Megan but for Violet as well. 
Apart from dealing with FBI Sara and her relationship with Jay, poor Violet is also being harassed by someone who is ringing her up, sending her gifts (and I use that term lightly) and writing threatening letters. 
 
Just as in The Body Finder we have some chapters that are from another individuals point of view however instead of us diving into the head of a serial killer we are given an insight into an individual who has evil intentions that are directed towards Violet. Once again I found this to be an exceptionally chilling aspect of the novel reading about someone (who at first we dont know) and getting into their head. This individual is so emotionally broken down due to their home life that they truly believe that Violet is blocking their path to happiness and must be dealt with and not in a pleasant manner. 
The strength of Desires of the Dead is definitely Violet, Kimberly has written such a realistic protagonist even though she is dealing with an extraordinary ability, you just cant help not loving her. I could understand and sympathize with Violets predicament of not wanting to tell her family and Jay about being harassed by someone and questioned by the FBI, she didnt want them to worry about her, theyve already done enough worrying. The way Kimberly described Violets swirling emotional state, in such a beautiful yet realistic portrayal, I was left with my heart breaking along with Violets when she was fighting with Jay.
Now I hear all you Jay lovers out there (for I am a self professed Jay lover too) what about Jay, fear not Jay is in the book and he is just as sweet and caring as ever, that boy would have to be the best boyfriend ever (note to Violet if you dont want Jay Ill take him off your hands). I was emotionally invested in both Jay and Violet in The Body Finder and this continued in Desires of the Dead, these two obviously belong together. There were some pretty heart wrenching scenes between both Violet and Jay, not everything in their relationship runs smoothly which is how a real relationship is, but then there were also some beautiful scenes between these two as well. All Jay wants to do is protect Violet and all Violet wants to do is to protect Jay, these two so clearly love each other its so sweet. 
Just like in The Body Finder Kimberly managed to outsmart me once again, I was so sure I knew what was going on and then all of a sudden my view was turned completely upside down and then it was turned once again for good measure. It is this unpredictableness that kept me on the edge of my seat reading throughout the day and night. 
I should mention that Desires of the Dead is not all serious, in fact one of my favourite aspects of the book was the banter that occurred between Chelsea and Violet, with Chelsea providing some great comic relief. One of my personal favourite quotes comes from Violet describing Chelsea
Chelsea was Chelsea. Trying to convince her that what shed done was wrong would be like banging your head against a brick wall. It would be painful to you but accomplish nothing. - page 169.
The ending was amazing, everything tied together as all the pieces Kimberly set in motion fell into place. There is definitely room for a continuation in Violets story, which will hopefully include more Rafe who Im interested in finding out more on. Of course it goes without saying more Jay is a must as well!
Desires of the Dead is an amazing sequel to The Body Finder which will leave you, once again, begging for more. ",0,1286841600.0,10110676,[],lost.in.stories,5.0,"Oct 12, 2010",59082,4181,2010-10-12,2010,10,0.0,0.0,2.5

The narrator, an insomniac, begins his journey by touring support groups where he feels release through the outpour of emotions. Unfortunately, another tourist shows up and he can no longer feel that release and thus creates an alter ego, Tyler Durden, through his split personality. The narrator and Tyler begin a fight club to feel the release the narrator could no longer feel from the support groups. As more and more men across the nation join the fight club franchise that is created, Project Mayhem is born out of its roots to combat society and Tyler Durdens army grows. The narrator struggles to find sanity as he constantly seeks Tyler Durden, as he gets closer and closer to rock bottom and as Project Mayhem escalates into a twisted plan to end life as we know it. Fight Club exhibits a point of view on society that I have never before encountered and somehow makes sense in a dark, eerie way. I recommend this book to young men everywhere and give it 5 stars.

388,"This is a strange but oddly powerful novel, which from what I gather pretty much sums up J G Ballard's work.
Cocaine Nights is set up as a murder mystery, but that's just a front. It's essentially a 'concept' book that has strong affinities with science fiction. Ballard is interested in what makes a group of people form something greater than themselves; let's call it a 'culture'. 
His test tube is a community of British expats living in gated 'communities' in Spain. They all stay home and take tranquilizers until something -- someone -- gets them stirred up. But then a tragedy occurs: a rich couple and their hangers-on are burned to death in deliberately-set fire, and our first-person narrator arrives in town to investigate because his younger brother's been arrested for the crime.
The 'whodunit' aspect of the book will disappoint murder mystery aficionados, but it's a very good read for anyone who wants to think about how the world really works. It's not clear how Ballard himself would answer the big questions he raises, but it's very enjoyable going along for the ride.
A couple of stylistic issues. First, even though he employs a first-person narrator, Ballard's tone is detached and almost hallucinatory at many points. This does not make for a 'sympathetic' reading experience. I also found that the first half of the book lagged quite a bit, but the second half takes off smartly. Finally, Ballard's a bit more didactic than he needs to be in hammering away at his socio-cultural musings. 
A good and interesting read, none the less. Recommended. ",3,1205452800.0,48246,[],mrtall,4.0,"Mar 14, 2008",64303,341833,2008-03-14,2008,3,0.0,0.0,2.0

3.75A Threefold Love by Robert D. Spake 
I was given this book in exchange for my honest review. 
Can a relationship truly work with three people, or will it completely ruin the original dynamics? On a harmless trip to the grocery store, two best friends lives will be forever changed, when a handsome stranger helps them. For the first time ever, the three are truly happy.
This is a short story, coming in around 20 pages. I really enjoyed the beginning of the story, and where it was going. Although I was not thrilled with where it ended. I could tell where it was going, because I have seen those things play out. 
I really wish it had a few more pages. Stronger character development, would have really added to this story. While I did feel emotional connected with the characters, I also felt that the story was rushed, in places. 
Thank you to the author for sharing their nontraditional affair with me 
3.5Incestua by Robert D. Spake 
I was given this book in exchange for my honest review. 
To be honest, I'm not real sure, what exactly I liked about this story, but I did. I can't put my finger on any one specific thing. It was just one of those ""I like it"" books. 
So this story involves a controversial subject. The story takes place in an ancient world, and involves the Greeks. Enough said? As per the title, I'm sure you've guessed, incest is brought up. When I got to that, I was like, ""What? Pause. Rewind. What? He did not just take it there."" But once the initial shock wore off, I thought, no big deal, I'd be more surprised if it wasn't there. We've all seen the movies, and even though I don't agree with it, it happened, deal with it. 
This is a short story with around 20 pages. I think we really missed out on a great epic battle scene. The potential was there, but the details just were not.
There were a few instances where the wording was a bit odd, but this might be attributed to word usage between countries. But did make a few spot slightly confusing. Such as I have no clue as to what a ""winged word."" 
Thanks to the author, I did enjoy the end, justice served. ",0,1373068800.0,14011804,[],Chantelle713,4.0,"Jul 6, 2013",5358,167915,2013-07-06,2013,7,0.0,0.0,2.0
400,"The Neverending story tells the tale of Bastian as he reads and eventually enters the Neverending story. I felt very much at though this book contained two stories, the one where Bastian reads the book and the one where he enters the book. I very much enjoyed the first half of the book, where Bastian is reading the neverending story and being pulled further and further into it, right to the point when he first entres Fantasia and does what he's been taken there to. The book is lovely, exciting, and Bastian's increasing involvement in and love for the book really draws the reader in too. 
The second half, I really felt was unnecessary. To me, what the childlike Empress said to Bastian when he first arrived in Fantasia was essentially the lesson Bastian came to about 150 pages later. In the first half of the book the kind of shallow fairytale telling of the Neverending story is counteracted by Bastian's reaction to the book, which we can all emphasise with. Personally, in the second half, I lost that feeling that I could understand Bastian, that Bastian was in a sense the same kind of child that I was. The writing seems a little dry. For example, we're told that Bastian and Atreyu are friends, but they never at any point aqctually seem to be friendly with each other. It just came across as quite flat. I would have been a lot happier if the book had cut of after the first half. ",1,1258070400.0,1174144,[],TPauSilver,3.0,"Nov 13, 2009",25591,68839,2009-11-13,2009,11,0.0,0.0,1.5

402,"No Safe Harbor is a captivating story, clearly book 1 in a series. Set in 1890s New York, No Safe Harbor tells the story of a young woman who emigrated from Ireland to find her twin brother, the brother who may be mixed up in the political discord of the day. Unbeknownst to her, Cara is searching for a brother who is being hunted by several parties blaming him for the deaths of their loved ones and thusly, fled to New York to hide. 
Upon arriving in New York, Cara meets Rourke. Ignoring her brother's admonishment to trust no one, she befriends Rourke and eventually falls in love with him. But Rourke is not who Cara believes him to be, and her growing feelings for him could put both her brother and herself in danger. For his part, Rourke is torn between is own growing feelings for Cara and his need to use her to find her brother.
Ludwig slowly parses out the truth about Rourke and about brother Eoghan. Rourke's truth quickly becomes apparent, but not Eoghan's nor that of some of the others who seek him, which makes the story a little confusing at times. Still, Ludwig does a good job of capturing turn of the century New York, I believe, and overall writes an intriguing historical that makes me wonder what the rest of the series will entail.

403,"Squires is a former long time executive editor of the Chicago Tribune who retires and moves to Kentucky to begin breeding thoroughbred horses - one of which became Monarchos who won the Kentucky Derby in 2001. Squires wrote the book in a hilarious self-depreciating manner that really carried the book at times - as the world of racing horses is a bizarre, sometimes backward world of odd characters, rules and money. The Thoroughbred business is home to some ridiculous egos who burn thru money like it's Kleenex trying to find the next winner of the Kentucky Derby.
Squires was about to give up his new enterprise after a few lean years and several losing investments in horses when he stumbled upon Monarchos' dam - Maria's Mon, who gives birth to several successful horses. What amazed me was simply how much money was thrown around at horse auctions long before any of the 3 year old compete in the Triple Crown races. Think of a free agent pool, where the horse's parental lineage and health records are the high school &amp; college draft numbers where the owners bid astronomical sums before ever watching the horse stretch it's legs on a track. The run-up to the Kentucky Derby is filled with all kinds of prep races and stakes races and the media hype begins long before May arrives. Squires also talks about once he sold his horse what happens after as he is a hapless bystander as his colt prepares and races in the Kentucky Derby. It's a really funny book, I found it enjoyable - it's not a terribly long book and it flies right by. It bounces back and forth between a husband and wife trying to run a small Kentucky farm while cheering on one of their horses on the world's biggest stages.

Emma is foster kid who has been moved from one home to another ever since her mother abandoned her. Sutton is a wealthy spoiled rich girl who has it all. Until she was murdered. When Emma finds out about her long lost twin sister she goes to visit her and gets forced into impersonating Sutton. Someone knows she's not Sutton and that someone is Sutton's killer.
Oh the intrigue! From page one this book will pull you in and just when you think you had things figured out, BAM! You don't know anything! There are a thousand questions piling up on top of each other and as soon as you get one answered twelve more are added! Shepard manages to pull this off without annoying the reader. She keeps you occupied with all sorts of interesting side stories and you get just a little snippet of information at a time. It will keep you hooked.
All the characters were fantastic. Emma is completely likable and the total opposite of her sister. I love how Shepard made Sutton a 'ghost'. She is there with Emma the entire time, but she can't communicate. Sutton chimes in with her opinion from time to time. It's a very interesting dynamic!
All in all, if you like Pretty Little Liars, you will like this book. I think I even liked it a little bit more!

411,"Wisteria is lucky really. In a time when a plague has ravaged the planet, she has managed to find a relatively safe place to live. True, she has to go out and track the zombie-like biters, but she has managed to make a relatively good life with her family. Things change one day though as she is trying to safe some people her age from biters. She is almost taken by them, but then she is rescued by a mysterious young man named Bach. Suddenly Wisteria's life is taking an interesting turn, and things will never be the same.
This book was like a zombie story and fantasy story all in one. It was very unique and original, and I loved that. Initially I felt a little thrown into the story, especially when Bach was introduced. I think it would have helped if I had read the glossary of terms at the beginning though. I just wanted to get into the story though! I did like Wisteria. She never tried too hard, but she was also very good-natured. I think she'd be someone I'd be friends with.
So the zombie-like Nero disease was pretty scary, but it was only one aspect of the book. The other involved Bach and his group of other-wordly beings. This for me was a slightly harder storyline to follow because it involved a lot of more intricate in-fighting. Also, you don't get some key parts of this story until later, so you may be confused for a bit. Don't let this get in the way of enjoying the story though. It manages to be creepy and entertaining all at once. The end will also leave you hanging. I am interested to see what happens next!

414,"I am so excited that christian publishers are giving parents more options in kids activities that have a christian theme. My three year old and I snuggled up on the couch to read the 'story' of Noah's Ark with a huge variety of activities!! It not only has stickers, a game, a spot the difference, counting fun, a recipe, a poem, what's that animal, etc. It was not your ordinary sticker book! It is a bit advanced for my three year old, but that is delightful that a 'consumable' book isn't consumed in one afternoon!! We 'stickered' a few pages, read most of it, but will have to revisit it later to do more of the activities. 
There are light spots in the same shape where a sticker should go, and the sticker page easily pulls out from the middle of the book to pull them off and put them right on. My daughter was delighted. Now that we have read it, I will add it to our church bag, and she will finish it mostly independently!! I was impressed that the sticker page was easy to get the stickers off of, my daughter is the queen of stickers these days and often I have to pull ALL the stickers of their backing for her. So this was a huge plus.
The content of the book was a very simplistic version of Noah's story. It was very sound with preschool age skills- colors (spelled colours), animals their sounds, counting, seasons, etc. It is an excellent educational tool and it is engaging. It has bright colors and warm people/animals to look at. My one criticism is the storyline which can be easily fixed by the parent or teacher reading aloud. You will have to add in the deeper theological content. Here's my take:
Please note: I am a bit of a critic and like even two year olds to hear doctrine directly. I wished that it was more direct and had stated that the people had sinned and caused God to destroy the people who did not seek Him. I wished it had pointed more to who God is and why we had a flood. It was very simple. It said that God said ""The rain will flood this bad old world."" That was it. It did end the story by saying that God said ""I will never send another flood."" I wished it had mentioned the promise God made and that it was a covenant! Like I said. I am a critic.
I would still use this book with kids. I found the activities delightful, entertaining, and not a one afternoon thing, this book would be revisited several times to be completely done. I think it is good for the 3 year old to even 7 or 8 year old range. Older kids would complete it faster, maybe in one or two afternoons, but the game and some activities could be revisited.

422,". Not sure how to classify thisI guess it would be sort of speculative, post-apocalyptic fiction of sorts. Its the story, mainly, of two peopleMargaret and Franklinand seems to be set in the future, a future in which America as we know it has disappeared. Were back to wood and bone implements, handmade homespun clothing, horse-drawn transportation (if were lucky!), no electricity and a rather bleak landscape in which people are leaving the country in drovesby ship. However, human seem to have changed little, and our age-old cruelty to one another, greediness, hunger for power and self-preservation instinct seems to have survived whatever catastrophe took place. And as always, small pockets of goodness and unselfishness will be found, too, if you look hard enough. 
Franklin and his brother Jackson, young men in their twenties, set out eastward for the sea after their fathers death and the family farm fails, leaving their mother to hold down the fort and knowing they probably wont see her again. Margaret, a single woman in her 30s who developed a flux of some sort, is quarantined in a hut on the edge of townFerrytownwith her head and body hair shaved off, basically left to either die or survive by her family, in hopes that they arent already afflicted. Through a set of bizarre circumstances, Franklin and Margaret end up traveling together eastward, then become separated, and end up together again towards the end of the book. 
Initially I found the book mesmerizing and couldnt put it down, but later wanted more information about what had happened to land America in such a state, and that information really wasnt forthcomingjust a lot of teaser kind of clues. Franklin and Margarets stories became a bit stale after awhile, though it was a good book overall and I did come away with some things to think about and ponder.

428,"Using the style and format that she did in her initial <u>Why?</u>, Slovenian children's author/artist Lila Prap turns her attention to our canine friends in <u>Doggy Whys</u> (original title: <u>Pasji Zakaji</u>), presenting a great deal of basic information about the species, while also highlighting the diversity of breeds. With each ""why?"" question answered in a variety of ways - here the silly answers are all given by cats, in a column on the left-hand side of each two-page spread - from nonsensical to factual, the book both entertains and informs. The artwork, in Prap's appealing style, is colorful and attention-grabbing.
In short, it's another picture-book winner from Prap, who came to my attention when her <u>Why?</u> was chosen as one of our November selections, over in the International Children's Book Club to which I belong. I enjoyed that foray into Slovenian children's books so much that I thought I would track down more of the author/artist's work - I now have five more of her books checked out from the library! - and this one did not disappoint.

429,"She is Earth's last protector. Hunter Maxine Kiss is the only thing standing between our world and the prison veils that keep demons from taking over our home. Passed down from mother-to-daughter for generations her own demons protect her body by day, resting as tattoos on her skin. At night her demons walk beside her, allies and parasites in their own right. 
I wish I could offer more details on the plot. A better synopsis, but I spent most of the time I was working through this book back-tracking trying to figure out what I had missed. Were there lines I needed to be reading between perhaps? Liu is a great author, she has a wonderful imagination, but there was something missing in this story. I later found out part of that may have been because the story actually begins in an anthology. Some readers may like this but I found it to be a stumbling block. Why should I be forced to go out and buy an anthology so I could get the first chapters of this new series? 
I tried to like it. I was very interested in the demons and how they came to be passed to Maxine and her maternal bloodline before her. Unfortunately very little was explained to help this part of the story along and while there were secondary characters I wanted to know more about and see more of I ended up finding Maxine herself to be a bit too two-dimensional for my tastes as a reader.

431,"Since I have spent much of the past month in European museums, it seemed fitting that my first review after my recent hiatus be <u>Chasing Aphrodite</u>, a book about the dodgy circumstances in which many of the finest antiquities from Greece and Italy ended up in American museums. The focus is on the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, after two Los Angeles Times reporters wrote a series of articles highlighting several pieces in the Gettys collection that were believed to be stolen by tomb robbers and sold on the black market. Jason Felch and Ralph Frammolino were named finalists for the 2006 Pulitzer Prize because of their investigation. <u>Chasing Aphrodite</u> takes their earlier work and digs even deeper into the suspicious activities of the Getty, weaving a complex narrative full of politics, intrigue and scandalous behavior from Americas greatest cultural institutions.
For a book that covers a long period of time - over fifty years  <u>Chasing Aphrodite</u> feels very fast-paced. The authors did a great job of cutting the story down to its essentials. For example, although Italian officials must have spent countless hours meticulously researching each contested piece of art, a few key scenes deliver a sense of their effort without belaboring it. The suspense and sense of urgency is retained throughout, so rather than reading a dry report this almost reads more like a thriller. 
Indeed, like many thrillers the book has its larger-than-life characters. One CEO of the Getty Trust made more than a million dollars a year (after the Getty reimbursed him for all his tax expenses), had a personal driver and car, and a generous retirement package. All this, he felt, wasnt nearly enough  even though, according to employees, he was very much an absentee boss. Or theres the two-faced curator who decries the avarice of museums that buy art of dubious origin while she purchases looted antiquities again and again. While the reporters do highlight the good each man or woman brought to the institution, its quickly forgotten next to the outrageous improprieties they committed. 
 Every year, I hear about source countries  Italy, Greece, Egypt, etc  asking for the return of stolen objects from museums around the world. Ive always wondered how valid the demands are. <u>Chasing Aphrodite </u>certainly proved that in the case of the Getty, curators knowingly bought stolen goods. It makes me wonder what other objects Ive seen in glass museum cases that were acquired in shady circumstances.

437,"Grapes of Wrath, by Joseph Steinbeck has stood the test of time as one of the ultimate testimonies of the American Dream. As the reader switches back and forth between the general public during the 1930s and a simple family from Oklahoma, they get a sense of the unfailing hope that families possessed for a better life in a foreign land. Although many families like the Joads were plagued by disaster after disaster, they still believed that things would get better for them in time. As they traveled across the country to California and dealt with death, discomfort and money problems, they assured themselves that things would turn up in time. As one character points out people are Movin cause they got to. Thats why folks always move. Movin cause they want somepin better n what they got. An thats the ony way theyll ever git it. Wantin it an needin it, theyll go out an git it (Steinbeck, 128). This stubborn attitude has become the American way; when you want something, you go out and get it. This is one of the reasons that Grapes of Wrath is a significant piece of American literature. Although Americans no longer go through what the Joads did, in small ways every day we make changes and sacrifices for a dream that may truly be impossible to reach, but we try anyway. Many Americans can relate to the Joads struggle. 
Furthermore, this makes Grapes of Wrath an important cultural text. Steinbeck shows the desperateness of humans when we are at our best and at our worst. People lean on each other and because they were lonely and perplexed, because they had all come from a place of sadness and worry and defeat, and because they were all going to a new mysterious place, they huddled together, they talked together; they shared their lives, their food, and the things they hoped for in the new country (193). In times of need Americans are there for each other, disregarding the harm they may be causing themselves by sharing food or shelter, only wanting to lighten anothers burden. At times like these in the book, I am proud to call myself an American. The unity that Steinbeck talks about is heartwarming. 
However, there are parts in the book where people are left to fend for themselves and turn their back on others. When a man is about to plow through anothers house with a tractor, he says cant think of [them]. Got to think of my own kids (17). This probably does help the man and his family survive, but at the cost of others. At these times the reader wonders about the cruelty of human nature, and what they would do in similar situations. One hopes that they would turn to others and try to stick together, but Steinbeck shows that that isnt always possible. 
Steinbeck takes the reader into a whole new world. The language he uses creates the authenticity of the southern, uneducated characters that he creates. Despite the broken English that is sometimes hard to decipher, Steinbeck leaves his mark as an eloquent writer by creating vivid landscapes and colorful characters. When he describes scenery or people, he always uses a lot of detail. When describing Tom for the first time, he says his eyes were very dark brown and there was a hint of brown pigment in his eyeballs. His cheek bones were high and wide, and strong deep lines cut down his cheeks, in curves beside his mouth. His upper lip was long, and since his teeth protruded, the lips stretched to cover them, for this man kept his lips closed. His hands were hard, with broad fingers and nails as thick and ridged as little clam shells (6). The whole book has this detail, and that creates a rich and lasting story.

438,"This is another difficult review to write. Irma's story, itself, is not particularly new. Italian immigrant in dying mountain village leaves for a better life in America, speaking not a word of English, creating a story to get her through customs. She is poorly educated and poorly skilled - sewing being the only skill she possessed. 
Irma meets a copper salesman and he provides transportation to Naples. He is a kind man who also picks up an orphan in a Typhus ridden village to deliver her to her aunt and uncle. They stay with his sister for one night and continue on, drop off the child and Irma buys her steerage ticket. She rides out a storm in third class, gets in a fight, her face is scarred but she makes friends. Exits ship, embarks on train to Cleveland, Ohio. Works in sweat shop for pittance but she's grateful for a job and so it continues while she runs into trouble here and there, embarks on new adventures where she is, once again, a stranger, and makes herself at home in Chicago and again in San Francisco.
There are a couple of aspects that sets this book apart from other immigrant books. The first and most important aspect is that the author wastes no time in establishing each character. It is only at the end of the book that I discovered that the story began as a short story and told of Irma until she walked away from Opi, her tiny Italian village. Writing a good short story is like learning how to use Twitter. You have 140 characters to say what you need to say. No words are wasted. No characters are wasted. Each person introduced is quickly established with a personality and all the needed characteristics to either be endearing or irritating and the author does not spend precious page space pontificating.
The second important aspect to this story is the imagery the author provides for the reader. Using all the senses without feeling like I've returned to College Writing 101, I saw, smelled, felt, heard, and tasted Opi, the ship (not pleasant), the trains, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco.
The third aspect is that the story told itself. Irma's conclusions to leave Opi and strike out to America are logical based on the state of the village. Finding a ride with a copper merchant is believable and I was relieved he was trustworthy. Passing a town afflicted with a plague, picking up a child, meeting the merchant's sisters and neighbors, buying the ticket, staying in a boarding house, etc. are all logical. People Irma meet on her journey are logical and not contrived. That leg of the journey ends and they continue in their own directions.
If the book were made into a movie, I would not see it. I would be bored. It is the author's style that makes this book a work of art. ",0,1293148800.0,10607440,[],amusingmother,5.0,"Dec 24, 2010",30317,23370,2010-12-24,2010,12,0.0,0.0,2.5

Having served as the secret envoy to Prime Ministers Rabin, Shamir, Netanyahu, Barak, and Sharon, Halevy was privy to the regions most sensitive information. Informed by his extraordinary access, he writes candidly about the workings of the Mossad, the Prime Ministers he served under and the other major players around the world: Yasir Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Hafez Assad, Muamar Qadaffi, Presidents Clinton and Bush, and former CIA directors Jim Angleton and George Tenet. Looking forward, he writes frankly about how the world might achieve peace. Much of what he has to say will surprise and shock even those readers well-versed in the complexities of the region. Sure to be one of the years most talked-about books, this fierce account of the Middle East will be a must-read for those seeking a functional and intelligent roadmap to peace in the Middle East and the world.

I started this book with a sense of excitement, as the topic of the book intrigued me. I knew someone, who was also classified a ""genius"" at a very young age. This person skipped grades in school and possessed a mind much different than those of the type of person you typically encounter. This friend of mine had such a different way at looking at life and challenges... and there always lied a curiosity within me about it. So, for me, this book was an interesting way for me to explore this type of mind, provided, however, that the book was well researched and written. And, that it was.

Ann Jacoby did an excellent job bringing the reader into the mind of a ""genius,"" which included the innate brilliance of the logical mind as well as the ability to comprehensively view of the minds of others surrounding them. In addition, my curiosity was perked... does a brilliant mind have the ability to see things, hear things, or know things intangible in nature? Let's use the example of ESP. Does a genius have the ability to use this part of his/her part brain that others just don't simply use, yet, as a result of human development or evolution? Do we all have the ability of ESP, however only certain minds are open to it at this stage in human evolution? Are genius minds a mere foreshadowing what is yet to come for all of us in 200 years? As we look back at our historical geniuses, their theories and ideas seem completely logical and discoverable to today's mind. So, is a genius an ""Early Bird"" mind of the future? I don't want to lose you, confuse you, or go too far out on a tangent here... but, it's a question I always wondered about. And, this novel provided me an interesting viewpoint into this topic. In Life After Genius, there are correlations to Einstein and famous mathematical thesis/theories dating back well into our history. And, today, these theories can be proved true or false based on tests made possible by modern science and technology. So.. the book was one that I really ""sunk my brain and my teeth into.""

M. Ann Jacoby says, ""Book Smart is not enough to get you through life."" I agree.
Jacoby states in her video about this book that this story is based upon the life of her father, a math genius. The video explains much of the basis upon which she started this book. Surprisingly enough, if I were to interview her, the questions that I would ask, she's well addressed in the video... so, visit the website. 
The novel is a story of Theodore Mead Fegley (""Mead""), a mathematical genius. He is faced with graduating college at the young age of 18 and publishing a thesis paper that would put both his university and himself on ""history's map."" A lot of pressure for a young man. Eight days before his college graduation, he quits school and returns home. There, he attempts to escape his life's troubles and become more of an unnoticeable type than one whose reputation precedes him. He becomes rather annoyed with his notoriety and wants to become more a ""face in the crowd"" type. His reputation and ability, at this stage in his life, is more of a hindrance than a benefit to him.
The book takes you back and forth between his past (i.e. what brought him back home in the first place) to what he experiences when he returns home. In returning home, we discover the characters of his family, my favorite being his Aunt Jewel. How his family interacts with him is very ""relate-able"" for me and completely realistic to what I'd expect from a family such as his. During the journey back into his childhood and college experience, the reader is introduced to his college classmates, roommates, professors, and advisers. His best friend, Herman, is a total creep... with this broken spirit that I believe the reader just wants Mead to help him repair. Herman is a very strong character in the story and if ever this novel is put to screen, the actor to portray him would be a very unique and talented guy!
This novel is intricate, with many moving parts to it. It is well written and it took my mind on a journey that I appreciated after the completion of the book.
My Favorite Quotes From The Book:
""Nothing soothes the soul of the savage beast like food.""
""Birds are supposed to fly south for the winter,"" Mead says, ""and flowers are supposed to bloom in the spring. Days are supposed to be long in summer and corn is supposed to be harvested in the fall. But I am neither a bird nor a flower nor a day of the week nor an ear of corn.""

This was a good book with a solid foundation. My reading pace was fast, but not ""skimmig"". I looked forward to cracking it open at the times I had available for reading. The story made me think. OK.. these are my signs for a good book. Therefore, I'm giving it an 8!

456,"The author Susan Campbell Bartoletti traveled to Ireland to conduct research of primary source material for this book and studied the Irish Gaelic language. From what I know I would say that the information is accurate and up to date. All the major facts are covered, the years, the number of deaths caused by the epidemic. The illustrations do not add much to the book. The illustrations are very similar and boring, I would have enjoyed more variety other than newspaper drawings of events regarding the Great Irish Famine. I believe the book was designed to give readers a good introduction to Irish history. Book is easy to read but there were too many stories of the events, I wish there was more factual information. The book did not read like a text book but a story, I think this is a plus for students and younger students but personally I had wished there was more facts, numbers, statistics, I actually wanted more of the textbook feel. Campbell does a great job discussing the tension between the Irish and the English people and the politics involved during this event. The text is appropriate for the audience but for an adult it was too elementary. Campbell provides the reader with a timeline, bibliography, sources, and an index for easy use. Overall, a great book for younger children, easy to follow and read but would only recommend to students who have interest in history. I enjoyed the book but with biases since I enjoy reading and learning about historical events.

461,"A call to liberals to stand up for their beliefs in the America of Bush and the neocons. A good overview of why we should be proud to be liberal and avoid capitulating to fear and partisan politics.
FDR saw fear as something the could paralyze a nation and prevent action. Bush (like Harry Truman and Vandenberg before him) saw fear as moving the nation to actionA cynic might say that the only thing Republicans had to fear was the end of fear itself. (p. 57) 
The party that once galvanized a nation by declaring that there is nothing to fear but fear itself has become afraid  afraid of being too liberal, afraid of being weak on defense, afraid of being culturally permissive, afraid of being seen as apologizing for big government. Democrats are obsesses with telling people who they are not. As a result, no one knows who they are. (p. 88) 
Bipartisanship is certainly honorable in the right cause. It is dishonorable when it serves as a way of dressing up extreme and partisan policies in the false colors of moderation. Honest opposition is always better then timid capitulation. (p. 103) 
It is possible,  to believe that the United States faces enemies who must be defeated without believing that the world is headed in the wrong direction. It makes more sense to see the forces behind those who blew up the World Trade Center and the Pentagon not as the wave of the future, but as marginal figures whose very extremism is an expression of frustration at the failure of their ideas. The evidence of the last fifteen years suggests that the power of those who support free societies and democratic values is on the ascendancy, not the decline. The most realistic view is that the United States will have more than enough allies in the battles it must fight and the work it must do  if it seriously seeks them out. Battling misguided pessimism is an essential task because when pessimists are wrong, they often bring about the very results they most fear. (p. 134)

463,"Where I got the book: it was already on my bookshelf, natch. A re-read because I'm facilitating the Book Wizards discussion, and then we're all going to see the movie!
Look, you're either a Tolkien fan or you aren't. I am. He really can put together a cracking story. It is, of course, the prequel to The Lord of the Rings - Bilbo Baggins is hired by a bunch of dwarves as their professional burglar, and off they go to rescue their legendary treasure from a lethal dragon and restore their kingdom. No pressure. On the way they meet trolls and elves and have adventures, during which Bilbo proves that there's more to a hobbit than meets the eye, a theme pursued in LOTR. 
I like the way this story turns ominous at the end, with Thorin, the chief Dwarf, being so blinded by his lust for treasure that he forgets all reason and fairness. LOTR tells us that the Dwarves have a tendency to delve too deep and awaken things that shouldn't be awakened. I can't help wondering if elves and dwarves aren't too sides of the same coin for JRRT, that coin being the intellectuals/scientists - after all it was Darwin's theories that led to social Darwinism and eventually, through some twisted thinking, to the Endlsung. The elves represent the apathetic aloof side of intellectual inquiry. That's just my off-the-hoof theory, but JRRT WAS a professor.
Anyway.
Great book.

467,"The quote on the front cover of this book says Barbara Erskines storytelling talent is undeniable, and having read the book, I can whole-heartedly agree.
This is a compelling time-slice story set in:
-	865  where we meet Eric, blacksmith and maker of a beautifully crafted sword which he calls Destiny Maker; Eric lives in an Anglo-Saxon village at a time when small villages on the East Anglian coast lived in constant risk from Viking invaders
-	1865  where we meet Dan, blacksmith and farrier who works for the Crosby family, whose Hall is built on the site of the original Anglo Saxon hall from Erics time
-	present day  where we meet Zoe and Ken, who have opted out of the rat race and relocated from London to Suffolk; their home is the barn conversion where Dan worked; their immediate neighbour, Leo, lives in what was originally the forge and Dans cottage.
The three stories are linked together by sightings of a ghostly Viking warship.
There are a host of interesting characters, including footpath diva Rosemary (who gets the whole village at loggerheads over her insistence on a footpath going across a farmers field rather than round it), and Sharon and Jeff, the neighbours from hell and their tearaway children.
I found that the book flowed well and it is an easy and enjoyable read. If you like a book that isnt too demanding and has a compelling story line, then you will enjoy this book.
So why only 3*s. Well for me, character is all; I really want to identify with the main characters and see that their attitudes shape their actions, and that in turn drives the story line. However, I found Zoe weak as a character, and the burgeoning relationship with Leo seemed trite and predictable. The other characters, even major ones like Ken &amp; Rosemary, seemed very one-dimensional  just there to hang the story off really. The most interesting character in the book was Jade (the 12 year old feral child)! I also thought the ending wrapped up all the relationships just too neatly and easily  real life is far more messy and painful!
All in all, not (in my opinion) one of Erskines best. But still an enjoyable read. ",0,1343433600.0,12455955,[],hashford,3.5,"Jul 28, 2012",47753,103531,2012-07-28,2012,7,0.0,0.0,1.75

470,"Many books have been written on greatness, chasing dreams, being effective or successful. Think of the influence Steve Jobs had on you and me, and what we thought after he passed away. Steven Furtick doesnt believe in one liners on motivational posters or inspirational images on Pinterest. He invites to open your imagination to the possibility that Gods has a vision for your life that is greater. Why? Because Jesus Christ promises us that with His help we believers may do greater things than He did (John 14:12). No, we cant be greater than He is, but can leave the normal, good is good enough status behind and strive for greater things, by starting small. you to Are you ready to open your imagination to the possibility that God has a vision for your life that is greater? Most believers arent in imminent danger of ruining their lives. Theyre facing a danger thats far greater: wasting them. In spite of all the parts of us that are anything but good, God is holding the door open to a life that is greater. Furtick uses the life of Elisha from the Old Testament as structure for his message. Powerful lessons of instant obedience, burning the proverbial plows that connect you to your (former) life, learning and practicing faith. God communicates vision differently to everyone He calls. He is working behind the scenes, orchestrating His destiny for you. God manages details, but may reveal only the next step for you. Thats enough to start a greater life. Stop waiting for what you want, and start working what youve got. Your greatest limitation is Gods greatest opportunity. The journey toward greater things is marked with setbacks and real suffering. Not that you seek suffering, but the devils active as well. Know, that God has never wasted an ounce of your faith. Our greatest setbacks in life can be the greatest setups to seeing Gods glory in places we didnt even know to look. And dont look on the outside. Outward, successful people may yearn for someting greater. Seek help, theres nothing from with preventive counseling. Greater isnt an automatic, permanent position; its an intentional daily decision. What matters most is not what you think you are or are not. What matters is what your Father sees in you and what He says about you. And like Elisha, dont test the waters, strike the waters with the mantle you received. Convincing, humorous, down-to-earth, yet bound for a greater life.

482,"Lucille Eichengreen was born Cecelia Landau in Hamburg, Germany. From Ashes to Life chronicles her Holocaust experience from the first moments of foreboding as antisemitism becomes more prevalent in Germany until after the war when she serves as a valuable witness against those who had committed such atrocities and then moves on to begin a new life in America. Eichengreen's story is told in spare, almost childlike prose that serves to avoid any distraction from the horror of the events described. 
Eichengreen chronicles her experience in the Lodz ghetto, where she lost what was left of her family, and in various concentration camps including Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. However, what sets this memoir apart from the others I have read is her elaboration on what happened after her liberation from Bergen-Belsen. Eichengreen's memoir goes on to tell us about her role in bringing 42 SS members to trial for war crimes and her experience testifying against them in court. Eichengreen's bravery in facing her opressors in court is astonishing, and she helps us to see both how necessary she believed it to be, how strange it was to have roles reversed, and how painful it was for her to take on this role. 
Additionally, Eichengreen tells of her new life in America and of a visit paid to Hamburg long after the end of the war. I was disappointed, as she was, by the relative lack of regret or remembrance she found in Germany and Poland. It was also shocking to see how the Jews that remained continued to conform to a persistent, if not always obvious, view of themselves as lesser humans that continued to exist in Germany and in Poland. Eichengreen spotlights what seems to be a reluctance to learn from history that is frightening. 
Eichengreen's Holocaust experience but more importantly her emergence from the Holocaust to a new life is difficult but necessary reading. Her post-war experience includes some unforgettable scenes, including meeting a former kapo in a New York store. From Ashes to Life is important reading for those who would learn about the Holocaust and who would strive to eliminate those attitudes that could keep history from repeating itself.

484,"Christine Feehans Dark Series. *sighs* Such a great series. To be honest, I discovered this series by accident and it was all due to a simple search online for book recommendations on Paranormal Romance. I had never really looked into such a series as it wasnt something I was familiar with. I had never actually dived into the world of erotic writing. Now that I have, I have to admit, I am one hundred percent HOOKED. 
Ms. Feehan has been writing the Dark Series since the early 80s and is still continuing with her next book due out this fall 2011. Because there are so many books in the Dark series and they all have the same basic premise, I thought it would help to give you the background for the novels first before getting into what is covered by each particular book. 
Deep in the Carpathian Mountains a hidden race of people are slowly dying out. The Carpathians are not human but some kind of sub-species; they are gifted with incredible powers such as an increased ability to see at night and an acute sense of smell and sharp hearing. They also are immensely strong and have the ability to shapeshift at will, talk to animals, are telepathic and can control the minds of humans. This species is immortal and often mistaken by the human race as Vampires. 
Along with these gifts the Carpathians can do magic and command the earth and weather. Whilst they need to feed on human blood for their strength and powers, a true Carpathian would never harm a human by doing so. They rest by day and hunt by night, so it is easy to see why -ignorant humans could mistake them for vampires!
While the Carpathians are blessed with longevity they are also cursed with falling birth rates amongst their kind and a shortage of females means that most males never find a mate. Males who dont find a life mate are condemned to lose their emotions, eventually the absence of feeling become too much for them to bear and they can either face the sun or turn into a vampire, one that loses their soul in exchange for a powerful high when making their kill. This is the only time that they get any kind of power or emotion and is often the leading factor for when the beast within gets too strong. Once a male turns vampire he starts to kill humans and Carpathians alike and must be destroyed before he kills too many people or calls too much attention to himself.
There is only one life mate for any Carpathian male and if he is lucky enough to find her, their souls join as one and the whole face to sun or turn into an evil vampire thing is avoided. They recognize their mates by having their emotions return, feeling overwhelming desire for that person and an overriding compulsion to bond with them. Every Carpathian male has a desperate need to find his mate.
Synopsis of Dark Prince
Mikhail Dubrinsky is Prince of the Carpathian race. As their leader he is one of the oldest Carpathians and has held out against the loss of his emotions for as long as he can for the sake of his people. Finally unable to hold out anymore he decides to seek the sun and end his existence.
Raven Whitney is a psychic who helps the US police track serial killers. After her last difficult case she travels to the Carpathian Mountains to find the mental peace and solitude that she craves. She telepathically hears Mikhails loneliness and anguish and reaches out with her mind to comfort him.
Mikhail tracks her and finds that she is human. Filled with an overwhelming desire for her he recognises her as his life mate and immediately set about trying to make her his.
Unfortunately Raven isnt the only foreign traveller staying in the town, vampire hunters have arrived looking for vampires to kill and they are not too choosy when it comes to deciding who is and isnt a vampire. Raven can sense their evil intentions but will she be able to stop them in time or will she fall pray to their evil plans too?
The Review
Dark Prince is the first novel in Christine Feehans Dark series. It gets off to a flying start with the two central characters meeting on the first page. The sparks fly and the romance that follows is generally riveting and spellbinding. Mikhail treads a fine line between being protective of his mate and overbearingly controlling. On the whole he manages to just about stay on the right side of the line. 
Raven is a character with an independent streak. Obviously that is going to cause a lot of the conflict between the two characters. 
Unfortunately for Raven when she does exert her independence she ends up nearly being killed and having to be rescued. 
I think that if you enjoy vampire romance and you should love this book. When it was published it was completely original and if the story seems a little tired now you have to remember that it has been much imitated since then. And most of the imitations havent been as good! 
While I considered Dark Prince to be somewhat of a slow read, it was actually filled with enticing scenes and at the end I was overall pretty happy about the contents of the book. ",0,1336608000.0,16195,[],Deserie.Comfort,4.0,"May 10, 2012",7352,187862,2012-05-10,2012,5,0.0,0.0,2.0

489,"Zoe and Jake are caught in an avalanche while skiing on holiday. Shaken and frightened, but with only minor injuries, they slowly make their way back to the nearest village and the hotel where they are staying, only to find it deserted. With the thread of second avalanche hanging over them they fear that the villagers and tourists have been evacuated and they have been forgotten and set out in search of rescue. But the mountain is foggy, dark and confusing and Zoe and Jake soon begin to fear that they are beyond normal help. And it isn't long before they both begin to experience visions and odd sightings that make them fear something sinister is taking place around them.
This was an odd book but on the whole I liked it. Throughout the book the author maintained a very dark atmosphere that was actually quite unsettling and scary in places. But there were a couple of jarring moments in the dialog between Jake and Zoe that felt forced and false. But they were mostly at the start of the book and by the end it felt more settled and realistic.

491,"My starting point for this book is an interesting one While I certainly know of Hurricane Katrina and the death and destruction she wroughtI did not see or hear any of the news reporting. I took a year off from the news in late 2004/2005  and missed all of that.
So I started Where We Know: New Orleans as Home with eyes unclouded by disaster footage, with ears clear of the voices of fear, anger, grief. This book is the closest Ive come to hearing from the residents of New Orleans  and these voices will stay with me for a very long while.
The book feels like its straight from the city itself. Theres a mix of themes, of attitudes, of perspectives, of stories. Theres no one real overlying message  except perhaps the emphasis of that very fact  that New Orleans is all things. The new and the old, the mystic and the modern, the laid back and the always ready for a party. The people of this city cannot be defined  nor can their feelings for this incredibly unique place.
It is not an easy thing to describe ones first impression of New Orleans; for while it actually resembles no other city upon the face of the earth, yet it recalls memories of a hundred cities.
After I finished admiring the binding and care put into the creation of the book, I fell into these words. One of the most amazing elements of the book is the juxtaposition of words written about New Orleans centuries ago with those written or spoken in the very recent past. They all speak of the same city  they all bring forth a facet of her  yet they are divided by hundreds of years, by race, by gender, by class.
From a writer in 1887: I suppose we are all wrongly made up and have a fallen nature; else why is it that while the most thrifty and neat and orderly city only wins our approval, and perhaps gratifies us intellectually, such a thriftless, battered and stained, and lazy old place as the French Quarter of New Orleans takes our hearts?
To a present day writer: So, now, here we all are, New Orleanians by birth or by choice, sitting on our stoops, watching the sun set and listening to the music of our city, a testimony to its endurance and vitality.
There is a spirit described in this book, whether of the city itself or of the people that are drawn to it, that draws the reader in. The varied voices create a beautiful music  a symphony of joy, pride, rage, despair, violence, fierce loveunderscored by strength. It seems as if no matter the circumstances, New Orleans and her people will find a way to adapt, without changing the soul of the place.
There are certainly times when the decision to save or replace the past is problematic. Here, however, there is more of a tendency not only to preserve the past, but to live alongside of it, to live in the midst of it. Our history is not for the museums. We still have a culture that comes from the city, from the neighborhoods; we still have a culture that connects to the past and parades in the streets.
Far more clearly (and probably more accurately) than any newscast I might have watched  this book gave me a vision of New Orleans that will not soon fade. ",2,1290988800.0,10457200,[],karieh,5.0,"Nov 29, 2010",53944,17950,2010-11-29,2010,11,0.0,0.0,2.5

493,"I really liked this book - I would cheerfully give it 4 stars from my own perspective, but following it can be a bit tricky. And explanations would be useful - not lots, but some terms and phrases should be in a glossary or footnoted (I had a similar issue with all the Spanish in Patron Saint of Plagues, but tarot/magic knowledge is less widely known.) But then again, it's a book about a magician (of sorts) so go in expecting some tricks and sleight of hand. 
Part of the confusion lies in that the story you see first isn't really connected to what happens next. First we are introduced to Jeremaih Rosemont, an art historian who took himself out of the mainstream, away from tenure and the pursuit of his career. He winds up in Nicaragua, and displays some unusual abilities to influence people, abilities and decisions he doesn't fully understand himself. In true conspiracy cannon, he is given an envelope with a ticket to Rome by a man outside the locked gates of his hostel, addressed to him, though no one would know where he is, etc. Naturally, he goes to Rome.
We are introduced then to Boy King, a tramp/homeless man in Minneapolis with a talent for reading tarot cards. He is being pursued by an unknown agent, possibly to do with the clashings of two ancient cults who strive for legitimacy/authenticity. 
It's a wild ride, and well written, but is a book you have to approach with no preconcieved notions of how the story unfolds. Ancient mythology, magic, tarot and academia all rolled into one mad package. ",0,1306886400.0,5063309,[],DoskoiPanda,3.5,"Jun 1, 2011",7740,351112,2011-06-01,2011,6,0.0,0.0,1.75
494,"Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea by Nikki Giovanni hums with the rhythm of spoken word poetry and the jazz of human experience. Each poem carries with it an essence that reflects the Black experience from the capture and transportation of slaves and what that should teach us about how to treat people to the lessons we carry with us once our relatives die. Her poetry is frank and honest, but it pulls no punches to ensure that readers understand that there are deep wrongs that can be learned from as long as we are willing to look at them closely. It may be difficult to review past transgressions without jumping to defend or shy away from shame, but her poems cause you to meet those challenges head on and to learn from our own follies.
At other times, her verse decries the blind eye that we turn every day to our own situations and histories, wishing that there were a different outcome or social norm. Giovannis poems focus a bit on the Black experience, but in many ways her verse and perspective transcends beyond those parameters to reach out to all of humanity.

499,"For the past several years, real-life adventure books have enjoyed a surge in popularity, a trend fueled in part by the best-selling success of Jon Krakauers Into Thin Air (1997), a riveting account of a disastrous Mount Everest expedition. Amazon Extreme follows in this tradition by relating the efforts of three young men to raft the entire length of the Amazon River. Written in diary format, the book chronicles the 150-day journey, with accompanying injuries, illnesses, and other brushes with danger.
Unfortunately, Amazon Extreme never captures the aura of excitement that Into Thin Air so effortlessly achieved. This may be due to the fact that Krakauer is himself a professional writer, while Colin Angus is not; Amazon Extreme was likely written primarily by the co-author, who did not actually participate in the expedition. The result seems contrived, particularly when the narrative transitions, somewhat less than gracefully, from the expedition events to reflections on Anguss life and family. And, to be frank, the book is simply a bit dull. Understandably, the three rafters swing between exhausted discouragement and unexpected elation, but after the twentieth time it becomes difficult for the reader to share in those feelings.

518,"Sergent First Class Jerry Zinsser was a decorated hero, who after rehabilitation, was assigned to Sergent Major Eric Moyer's team as his new surveillance specialist. Moyer's Special Operations unit has been assigned to track down an Egyptian terrorist that uses women suicide bombers to fulfill his ""contract"" with a Mexican drug Lord. Zinsser, who struggles with hidden demons, tries his best to be an asset to the team, but instead, may put the whole team at risk.
If you only read one book this year, Blaze of Glory should be the one. Written by Major Jeff Struecker, (one of the heroes featured in Black Hawk Down), this book kept me on pins and needles throughout the whole story. It was so realistic I had to keep telling myself it's fiction. The characters were amazing and have left such an impression that won't easily be forgotten. The situations the team dealt with were terrifying, and I had to remind myself to breathe at times. This military thriller is most definitely a real page-turner that held me spell-bound in its clutches from the first chapter. This is truly one of the best books I've ever read. Major Jeff Struecker is one author that should be noticed and put on everyone's to-watch list. His gripping realism has left me awestruck and I can't wait to read more of his work!

519,"This is the fourth (sixth) in the series, with stories about summer and new people and places. The book starts with Akari narrating that it is her second summer on Aqua, thus a full year of story-time has passed since AQUA Volume 2.
As is typical with the Tokyopop editions, many drawings suffer for not being in full-color, as originally published in MAG GARDEN, and it's a bit strange to not have honorifics after hearing them all the time in the radio dramas and anime, but the charm of ARIA and Kozue Amano's drawings and story still shine through.
This isn't necessarily my favorite of the volumes I've read so far, but I think it's because in each of the five Navigations, Akari is meeting someone new or going to a new place, so there's an introductory feel instead of the established settings and characters (not that we don't have the usual Neo-Venezia or cast, but the feel is a bit off). Nonetheless, part of the charm of ARIA is Akari's encounters with new people and places, and the joy of it all, so I still quite like this volume, even if it isn't my favorite.
Navigation 16 (""Neverland"") is about a day of play, when Alicia and Akira invite Akari, Aika, and Alice to a hidden cove for a break from their training. Akari swims in the ocean for the first time, and we all learn that happiness can be found anywhere. (Isn't that a main theme for the series?)
Navigation 17 (""Traveling Water"") has some supernatural elements to it, which are always a little odd but fitting in this setting. It is the very hottest part of summer, and Akari notices a mirage on the water. When she goes into town to buy a night chime (see the second volume of AQUA for the first time she buys one), she finds mirages on the streets, too, and decides to enter a dark caf to rest from the intense heat. But the caf is part of a mirage, too? Somehow, the mood and pace of this chapter really seemed to fit the hot summer day, and though I read it in November, I could easily remember similar July days when the heat was unbearable and everything seemed to move so slowly. 
Navigation 18 (""Flying Fish in the Sky"") introduces the fourth occupation that is vital to the Neo-Venezia economy (apparently?). At least, it's the fourth one with a mythological name - as with the Undines (gondoliers and the representatives of Neo-Venezia to tourists), Salamanders (climate control), and Gnomes (gravity control), the air-bike riding couriers are known as Sylphs. Akari meets Woody, who is apparently an expy from Amano's work Roman Club (even his bike reads ""Roman"" on the side) and is a bit of an airheaded clutz. But he's also great fun and warm-hearted and when he loses his map, Akari and President Aria go with him on a delivery, in order to help him find his way.
The two-page spread of Neo-Venezia as seen from the sky is one of the best parts of Navigation 18. It's a really neat illustration, though I worry whenever I see it that President Aria's grip on Akari is about to fail, and he'll be falling down down down to the water.
In Navigation 19 (""The Legendary Major Fairy""), Akari, Aika, and Alice visit ""Grandmother"", a retired Undine who established Aria Company, and who is known as the best Undine ever. Aika believes that they are paying the visit in order to learn how to become primas, but Grandma just wants them to enjoy themselves. As with Navigation 16, the final lesson Grandma gives in this chapter is probably one that's applicable to the entire series - one must enjoy one's work and have fun doing it in order to do it well.
The final chapter, Navigation 20 (""The Redentore""), brings the entire cast together in one of the first real tests of the three trainees' skills as hostesses. They must prepare a boat, the refreshments, and the entertainment for seven people for the Redentore, which is a night in the summer when everyone goes out on boats to party, and then watch the fireworks over the water. I'm not as fond of this chapter as others, because it feels a bit too crowded, like there wasn't really enough time spent showing how the girls did their preparations. Also, the fact that Akatsuki, Al, and Woody were all old friends seemed a bit too convenient for me, though I don't mind it. It's just something that added to the way the chapter didn't work for me.

524,"The second book in the Emerald O'Brien saga follows the difficulties that arise in her relationship with Andrew and her friendship with Joe, a younger, hot Chief of EMTs. And of course we see Emerald dealing with the challenges of single motherhood.
This story follows a lovely jade dragon Emerald acquires via tragic circumstances. As a result things in her life seem to go haywire. Her shop is robbed, her home is vandalized and then robbed as well as other assorted bizarre incidents. 
She is also very leery of Oliver, Mrs. Trask's newly paroled nephew who just seem to give off a negative vibe.
To me, the mystery is backdrop against which I got to spend some more time with Emerald and her family. I like these characters. They're not perfect but they are likable. And the story behind the jade dragon is interesting too.
I found this book to be an easy read and I'll probably end up re-reading it one of these day.

Recommended Ages: Gr. 3-7
Plot Summary: Evan and his sister Jessie have had a great summer, up until now. With only 5 days left, a letter from the school arrives in the mail. It explains that Jessie and Evan will be in the same 4th grade class because they don't have enough students to split them up. Normally, that wouldn't be a problem. Evan loves hanging out with Jessie. But Jessie is skipping third grade and Evan is worried that everyone is going to realize his younger sister is smarter than him. So with only five days left of summer, Evan is grouchy. Jessie doesn't understand what is making Evan so upset. And she is even more confused when he discards her idea to have a lemonade stand but then has SS over for one. She decides to have a lemonade stand with Megan Moriarty, a 4th grader, so that she can show Evan how much fun she is having and he'll come over and join them. Only it doesn't work like that. Evan sees the lemonade stand and is furious that his sister is trying to be better than him,. A war is on. They bet that whoever can make $100 before the fireworks show on the last day of summer break wins. The other person has to give their money to the winner, so that would be Evan's iPod fund or Jessie's charity of choice. They each use creative methods to make money, but who will be the winner? 
Setting: suburb relatively close to a beach (took 2.5 hours to get to beach with crazy traffic)
Characters:
Evan Treski - 10 y/o, going into 4th grade, Evan and Jessie made a spit pact to not fight in front of their mom because they didn't want to see her upset, struggles with math and other school subjects but is better with people, has 3 good guy friends
Jessie Treski - 8 y/o, Evan's little sister, doesn't understand feelings and has Evan explain what people might be thinking but is ridiculously smart in math
Mrs. Treski - works in her attic office all the time but her job is not explained, divorced her ex a few years ago after a lot of fighting
Megan Moriarty - same grade as Evan, asks about him all the time but in a friendly not annoying way
SS - can't remember exact name, same grade as Evan, a jerk who ends up hanging out with Evan every once in a while
Recurring Themes: skip grade, math, feelings, anger, sibling rivalry, summer break, business models
Controversial Issues: none that I can remember (maybe one crap?)
Personal Thoughts: This is a good example of sibling rivalry but in a nice way. Even when they are mad at each other, they still stop to consider the other person and they miss the other sibling. It had more of a happy tone even when they were fighting because I understood the love was there too. Overall, I liked this book. Good character development, I liked the math and the business models. I don't truly believe a school would let a second grader skip to 4th grade if she had such a hard time reading people's emotions, but it was easy enough to forget that little detail and pay attention to the story.
Genre: realistic fiction (math)
Pacing: fast-medium, not long lasting suspense but story moves quickly, didn't see book to know how math equations are laid out on a page
Characters: very well developed except I wanted to know more about their mom's job
Frame: math is laid out to relate to real life, helps to be familiar with math, might be more likely to teach how math relates to real life and general tips to solve math problem (ie. draw a picture but doesn't explain how) rather than how to set up and solve every problem

I got to go to Italy for two glorious food and art filled weeks. The food. The food. It was some of the best food I had ever eaten in my life; the best meal? Roast chicken. Can you imagine?

534,"Having acquired the Index to the Oversoul and their wives, Volemak and his family begin their long journey to home of the Oversoul. And a long journey it is, with regular extended stops to accommodate pregnancies and births and the need to restock and refuel. Eventually, however, the party reaches their version of Eden where some of the old hurts can rest. But Nafai senses that something is wrong. The Oversoul is delaying too long. The group is ready to go, but the Oversoul either cannot or will not lead them to the Ships that will take them to Earth. So Nafai takes it upon himself to find the ships and kick group into the next phase of the journey.
As much as I appreciate seeing Nafai grow into the role of the leader, I don't believe that his reluctance is believable. He claims that all he wants in Ellemak's love and respect, but someone as perceptive as he is shown to be must, at some point, come to the realization that what he wants will not come. But he continues to subject himself to punishment and torture in the hopes that Ellemak will eventually stop hating him. And for his part, Ellemak seems to be smart enough to realize that he is well down the path of personifying pure evil. I cannot envision a person so consumed with a desire for power that he would allow himself to be corrupted by his own hatred. At some point, he's got to give it up and reconcile.
The one thing, though, that really caught my imagination was the recognition of the amount of time that it took for the Oversoul to breed the 16 people that started the journey. The entire population of the Harmony was evaluated and those that exhibited the desired traits were brought together by the Oversoul for the purpose of creating these 16. How long would that have taken? Thousands of years? Was the city of Basilica created as the creche for the Oversoul's breeding program? Was the culture of Basilica (year long marriages, female dominated society, center of arts and learning) constructed purely to facilitate this breeding program? What about the 'Holy Women'? Were *ALL* of them brought to Basilica the way Thirsty was; simply to take part in this very unnatural selection? Very interesting questions...
And, oh by the way... While I understand the need for the Starmaster's Cloak given Ellemak's escalation of violence, it still seems like a cop out... ",1,1283990400.0,28150,[],helver,5.0,"Sep 9, 2010",48073,257395,2010-09-09,2010,9,0.0,0.0,2.5

Stieg Larsson (born August 15, 1954 in Skelleftehamn, Sweden as Karl Stig-Erland Larsson) was a Swedish journalist and writer who passed away in 2004. 
As a journalist and editor of the magazine Expo, Larsson was active in documenting and exposing Swedish extreme right and racist organizations. When he died at the age of 50, Larsson left three unpublished thrillers and unfinished manuscripts for more. The first three books (Mn som hatar kvinnor/The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Flickan Som Lekte Med Elden/The Girl Who Played With Fire, and Luftslottet som sprngdes/The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest) have since been printed as the Millenium series. These books are all bestsellers in Sweden and in several other countries, including the United States. 
<b>The synopsis</b>

With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, she will plot revengeagainst the man who tried to kill her, and the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.
Once upon a time, she was a victim. Now Salander is fighting back. 
<b>The review</b>
This book is the third in the Millenium series and gives all the answers. There are some new players but most have been there trough all three books. Some characters still surprise you though. I feel this book is a worthy end to the trilogy it has Cluedo things innit and some of the action which makes it a intriguing read. If you are a crime novel reader and ignored these books cause you had the feeling they where not your style and you are emotionally able to deal with the sever abuse that sometimes pops up you should read these books.

At the request of her daughter Emily, Henrie O accompanies her young-adult grandchildren, Diana and Neal, to Bermuda for the wedding of their father  Henrie Os former son-in-law Lloyd Drake  to wealthy widow, Connor Bailey. Not everyone is overjoyed with the match-up. Connor Bailey is high-strung, high-maintenance, high-drama, a dark-haired beauty many men cant help falling for. Trouble seems to follow her.
The bride-to-be herself is not all that happy about being in Bermuda, either. Just a year earlier, Roddy Worrell, the owner with his wife of the Tower Ridge House where the wedding party is staying, died in a fall from the tower. Although Worrells death was ruled accidental, some people thought he was pushed, and that his flirtation with Connor Bailey precipitated it. At the time of Worrells death, many of the Bailey-Drake wedding guests were vacationing at the Tower Ridge House. Bermuda was where Lloyd and Connor fell in love and where Connors daughter Marlow met her now fiance, the handsome Aaron Reed. Ever the romantic, Lloyd wants to be married on Bermuda and he prevails.
Adding to the negative aura surrounding the impending wedding is a ghost  some believe Roddy Worrells ghost. Henrie O, a no-nonsense, seventyish, retired journalist, doesnt buy the ghost theory for a minute. In fact, she believes young waiter George Smith, who appears to be promoting the ghost story, is behind the eerie appearances and threats directed at Connor. She offers him money to make the ghost disappear, but suddenly he wants her to up the ante. Soon George is dead  murdered. Henrie O is convinced someone put George up to the ghost shenanigans and wants to find out who . and why.
Then a second murder at Tower Ridge House touches Henrie Os family even more directly and she steps up her efforts to find the murderer and protect them.
Carolyn Hart usually delivers a good story and this one wont let her readers down. I had read and enjoyed the first four Henrie O mysteries, but was a very disappointed in #5, Death on the River Walk, so disappointed I almost decided to give up on the series. When Resort to Murder came out in hardcover, however, I remembered how I had enjoyed the earlier books and decided to give Henrie O another chance. Im glad I did. 
The author set the stage very well  describing the characters and relationships early in the book. She revealed enough about Bermuda to make the setting interesting  but not so much that it read like a travel guide. Resort to Murder had plenty of suspects and enough clues to help readers solve the murders right along with Henrie O. Carolyn Hart is a solid writer who plays fair with readers.
Ive always had a soft spot for mysteries featuring older women  even before I was one. Dorothy Gilmans Mrs. Pollifax and Agatha Christies Miss Marple were among my early favorites. I believe Henrie O belongs in their company.

545,"I love Hesse, one of my favorite authors ever. Not only is the spirtualism/sensualism dichotomy (which forms the major theme of all of his works) one of the more interesting philosophical questions of mankind, but I can't think of any author who has continually revealed his own personal neuroses and self-doubts through their characters. This quality has always provoked a certain empathy, admiration, and even self-recognition when I read his books. As someone concerned with those important questions of life, I can identify with his characters, and, because his characters are so autobiographical, I feel like I can consequently identify with Hesse himself.
One of the more fascinating thought exercises related to Hesse is studying his works as attempts to reconcile these two aspects of life: the ethereal, divine and ecstatic with the corporeal, material and sensual. As brilliant as he was, he never figured out how to do it completely, which is what makes all of his novels ultimately unsatisfying. The interesting part, however, is that each successive novel comes closer to the answer, so that Demian feels by far the least developed, and while Hesse realizes ""Nirvana"" in Siddhartha, it never feels authentically earned. Steppenwolf feels altogether more on the right track before devolving into a psychedelic madhouse (perhaps precisely because he didn't know where next to take it?), and then Narcissus and Goldmund and The Journey to the East get even closer to the ultimate reconciliation while still falling short. The Glass Bead Game is by far the most developed of his novels and gets tantalizingly close to a ""solution"" for this problem, but it still leaves the reader vaguely grasping at the ""how"" of Hesse's prescription. 
As obsessed as Hesse was with this issue, he was never able to solve it, and it leaves us with the suspicion that it is an insoluble problem, perhaps THE insoluble issue of humanity. His books are so enjoyable, though, precisely because nobody has ever taken up the question with such earnest seriousness. All of his books leave us unsatisfied, but upon further thought one concludes that they are unsatisfactory only because they so unerringly reflect the great human predicament: the paradox of the divine animal. **Full Disclosure: I can no longer remember concretely, but I suspect that I owe a lot of credit for this analysis to Colin Wilson, from his fantastic The Outsider.** ",0,1374969600.0,8422,[],blake.rosser,3.0,"Jul 28, 2013",33945,451595,2013-07-28,2013,7,0.033333333333333326,0.09999999999999998,1.55

547,"This is a good example of realistic fiction because it follows two kids as they go to the zoo and see a lot of animals. It is very realistic in that the animals do not talk and that the kids are staying behind the fences. They are also feeding the animals food that the animals would normally eat. It is a good story that kids can relate to. The plot of this story is a good example of repition. Because it is a book that helps kids learn to read, it repeats main words in the story such as ""hungry"", ""saw"", ""gave"", ""eat"", etc. As the kids walk around and see each different area with animals, they notice that the animals are hungry, so they feed them food based on what animals they are. The end throws a little twist to it, as it says they saw the lions and tigers that look hungry, but instead of telling us what they gave them, it says, ""They gave us a fright! Roar!""

548,"Samson Gallows runs a pawn shop in South Philly and he's involved in a little side business with his brother, Markey, if you get my drift.
The story starts with a drugy walking into the shop, wanting to pawn a 3,000 year old, mummified head.
Robert Ford's writing is as real as a Philly cheesesteak, one from Geno's or Pat's, if you will.
Bob knows his craft and how to paint a picture. ""I drove back through Rittenhouse Square and saw the bum was still there. He was ankle-deep in the fountain, standing in his own water-piss, conducting an orchestra of pigeons to whatever music played in his head.""
Samson and Denial is filled with great characters defined by wonderful prose. Take Wimer Finnegan, a 3rd generation barkeep-owner of Finnegan's tavern, who leans over his bar when Samson comes into his establishment for the 1st time in many years, and says, ""If you knew everything you needed to know, you wouldn't be here. If you didn't know anything at all, you wouldn't be here. And I know damned well you're not here for the ambience of my upscale drinking establishment. So quit fuckin' around and just ask. What do you need to know?""
Just when I was wondering why we hadn't heard any more about the mummified head, all hell breaks loose. Plenty of action with with everyone from the Russian mob to the Crimson Sisterhood (you really need to be there).
Only a novella, damn. This was just too good to end. Bob tells me he's mulling over a sequel. I'd spend my money on it.
Not for the faint of heart, due to strong language and plenty of violence, but frankly, I love that stuff.

550,"Acostumamo-nos a sempre encarar a oposio de Paulo direcionada aos judaizantes ou judeus-cristos, mas recentemente estamos vendo alguns especialistas levantarem a hiptese do evangelho de Paulo ser contra-imperial.
 exatamente esta a tese de Richard Horsley em seu livro Paulo e o imprio: religio e poder na sociedade imperial romana, Paulus, 204.
Dividido em 4 partes contendo 14 captulos escritos por diferentes especialistas o livro pretende demonstrar que o cristianismo foi um produto do imprio e que numa das grandes ironias da histria o que veio a ser a religio estabelecida do imprio comeou como um movimento anti-imperial. Na verdade, este  o primeiro de dois livros organizados por Horsley que trata do assunto, um mais recente, ainda no publicado no Brasil, tem como ttulo Paulo e a ordem imperial.
Nas duas primeiras partes do livro compreendendo 7 ensaios so abordados dois temas preliminares para a introduo do evangelho contra-imperial. So elas, na Parte 1, O Evangelho da Salvao Imperial que aborda a disseminao do Evangelho de Cesar que j se estabelecera em cidades como Filipos, Tessalnica e Corntio e na Parte 2 Patronato, Sacerdotados e Poder.
Nestas introdues Paulo e sua obra, praticamente, no so tratados e o enfoque se situa na religio-poltica da Roma Augustana.
Na primeira parte o ""culto ao imperador""  contraposto em 4 ensaios ao cristianismo da Igreja Primitiva.
Na segunda parte em 3 ensaios Relaes Patronais do Poder, Patronato na Corinto romana e o Vu do Poder, de autores distintos, produzem um interessante estudo sobre as relaes de poder no imprio romano e tentam explicar como uma administrao imperial de pouca complexidade conseguiu manter ntegro um imprio remoto e complexo.
Ao desfilarmos sobre os ensaios sobre o patronato no podemos deixar de identificar uma estreita relao com as relaes de poder na sociedade brasileira.  to grande a similaridade que me inspirou a escrever um pequeno artigo que intitulei Roma Imperial  aqui.
 de se destacar, para evidenciar a institucionalizao do patronato e do trfico de influncia, o conselho de Plutarco, filsofo e prosador grego do perodo greco-romano, que viveu certo perodo em Roma, de como um jovem devia agir para conseguir um cargo poltico local que se constitui em um indicativo de como funcionava o sistema:
No s precisa o homem de Estado manter a si e  sua cidade ilibados aos olhos dos dirigentes, mas ter sempre algum amigo nos crculos dos mais poderosos (em Roma) como um firme apoio  cidade. Porque os prprios romanos mostram-se mais simpticos aos esforos cvicos dos amigos. E  bom que quem goza de benefcios em funo da amizade com os poderosos os usem em favor da prosperidade do povo (Moralia 814C).
Na parte 3 O Evangelho contra-imperial de Paulo, com o contedo de 4 ensaios, Deus virado de Cabea para baixo, A ideologia Imperial e a Escatologia de Paulo em 1 Tessalonicences, A Mensagem Imperial da Cruz e Romanos 13: 1-7 no contexto da propaganda imperial, entramos finalmente no objeto do livro.
Alerto aos leitores que as evidncias da tese no se mostram de forma clara e podem dar margem a contestaes. Trs cartas de Paulo so apresentadas como as que possuem maior testemunho da ao poltica contra-imperial de Paulo: Romanos, Filipenses e Tessalonicenses.
As anlises partem do uso de termos especficos em grego que denotariam o sentido poltico ou imperial.
No terceiro ensaio, A Mensagem antiimperial da cruz, Neil Elliott aborda o carter poltico da morte de Jesus e de como a chamada ""Pax Romana""  desprezada por Paulo.
No quarto ensaio desta parte o mesmo autor examina Romanos 13:1-7 no contexto da propaganda imperial e procura explicar a questo do propsito da carta em relao  surpreendente orientao contida nestes versculos.
Na parte 4, A construo de uma sociedade alternativa, os trs ensaios, procuram situar a misso de Paulo em um estgio bem maior do que a fundao de uma nova religio e afirmam categoricamente que  historicamente sem fundamento imaginar que j existisse na poca de Paulo uma religio chamada judasmo e outra chamada cristianismo.
Uma interessante anlise sobre um importante termo utilizado por Paulo procura mostrar que ekklesia no pode ser traduzido como ""Igreja"". Ekklesia seria um termo poltico com certas tonalidades religiosas.
As ekklesias de Paulo seriam, portanto, comunidades locais de uma sociedade alternativa  ordem imperial romana. Realmente algo que est longe dos plpitos de pregao paulina.
O primeiro ensaio desta parte estuda Os Cultos Imperiais de Tessalnica e o Conflito Poltico em 1 Tessalonicences. Aqui o conflito mal explicado de Atos 17 quando a casa do patrocinador de Paulo, Jaso, foi atacada  analisado de forma poltica. Quais so os dogmata kaisaros que Paulo e seus companheiros violaram?
O autor do ensaio Karl Donfried levanta dados argumentando que as tribulaes mencionadas em Ts 1:6 podem ter relao com o culto ao deus imperial no templo de Csar existente em Tessalnica, construdo no reinado de Augusto. A alegao de Paulo de que Satans o impediu vrias vezes de visitar a cidade em TS. 2:18 poderia ser uma indicao da oposio poltica?
No ltimo ensaio do livro, 1 Corntios: estudo de caso da Assemblia de Paulo como sociedade alternativa, o organizador Richard Horsley, faz uma releitura desta generosa fonte de textos usada pelos cristos como bases bblicas e de doutrina teolgicas para dar ateno a outro horizonte em cujo mbito Paulo compreende as lutas da assemblia, bem como  radical oposio de Paulo  ordem imperial romana.
No podemos deixar de notar que a tese  revolucionria e est sendo abraada por muitos especialistas, mas muita gua deve rolar ainda at que seja suficientemente entendida e aceita.
Na minha primeira leitura do livro, em que pese ter apreciado logo de incio as duas primeiras partes, foi de rejeit-lo, mas lendo e relendo com cuidado comecei a achar que muita coisa faz sentido.
O segundo livro que mencionei acima no parece ter ainda traduo em portugus, mas quem se interessar existe uma resenha no site Review of Biblical Literature.

554,"This review and analysis of German girls fiction (Mdchenliteratur) was published in 1970, and while some of the author's ideas certainly make sense, I am not all that impressed with and by the general negativity that is shown regarding almost all girls' fiction written in the early and middle part of the 20th century. No doubt, some, perhaps even much of the criticism was/is deserved, but the almost vindictive tone of voice and the author's tendency to dismiss all early girls' fiction (and girls' fiction in general) as not only conservative, but as abusive and/or borderline fascist, is a bit too extreme for my tastes. 
Dahrendorf is really throwing the proverbial baby out with the bath water here, and his inherent negativity actually prevents his good points and valid arguments regarding girls' literature to be both properly identified and taken seriously. Not a terrible or useless work, but I do wish it had been toned down a bit. The book almost makes one feel not only guilty about enjoying/reading literature for girls in general, but that liking and reading German literature for girls in particular is tantamount to supporting both female disenfranchisement and Fascism (or even Nazism).

556,"North and South was first published in 1854. As was common in those times, it was serialized in a magazine. The title refers to the contrast between the north of England, which is very industrial, and the wealthier, and more agricultural, south. Cultural differences and classism are seen through the eyes and experiences of the main character, Margaret Hale. As a young woman of 19, Margaret is transplanted to the north when her clergyman father decides to leave the church and pursue other employment. Margaret is accustomed to a life of relative leisure, and is thrust into an industrial town where textile mills drive the local economy.
In the north Margaret comes in direct contact with poorer, lower classes -- who are typically laborers in the mills. She gains an understanding of working conditions and resulting health issues. She seems to move seamlessly between classes, simultaneously befriending a local laborer and his family, and a wealthy mill owner named John Thornton. Gaskell portrays the lower classes as hard-working, honest folk and the upper classes as haughty and insensitive. Towards the end of the novel Margaret finds herself again in the south, and it is clear her life in the north has changed her world view. She does not enjoy the parties and leisurely pace; in fact, she feels guilty about having these privileges when there are so many who struggle to meet basic needs.
While North and South is an effective portrayal of Victorian England and class differences, the pace was a bit slow and the plot, predictable. While there is a romantic thread to the story, I did not care enough about the characters to be pulling for a happy ending. Sometimes when reading classics, I find it helpful to consult other sources to better understand the themes. But even that didn't help me much; in the end this book left me a bit flat.

560,"This was such an interesting novel that was packed full of historical information about the Civil War. It brought us from the high society in Baltimore, Maryland, to battlefields in Virginia, and finally an Army Hospital in Washington, D.C.. Walt Whitman is introduced very early in the book as he spends time with a young wounded soldier named William Prentiss. During their time together, Whitman learns of many significant events that have happened to William over the course of the last four years.
Shortly after William passes away in the hospital (since this happens very early on in the book I don't think I'm giving much away) Whitman is asked to meet with William's brothers and share the conversations that they had during his last days. As Whitman recounts his conversations, and William's brother Clifton shares his experiences, we are given a vivid picture of how the Civil War could affect a family that harbored different political views.
This book was quite the history lesson for me! During this time period, Maryland obviously joined the United States of America, but the Confederate States of America was still a force to be reckoned with. From what I understood in the novel, Abraham Lincoln was the President of the United States as Jefferson Davis was also the president of the Confederate States. For some reason I really had a problem grasping this concept.
John Prentiss is the father of William and Clifton, and is in support of the Union actions. Although he sees the differences in his sons, as William supports the Confederacy, and Clifton supports the Union, he longs for his sons to set their politics aside to remember that they are brothers. As the brothers are preparing to depart for battle they bump into each other on the street one day. The following excerpt explains their brief reunion from page 69:
The brothers stood staring at one another, the stark difference in their uniforms declaring that they had chosen opposite sides in the looming conflict. Their facial expressions were a mixture of shock and dismay. After a moment, Clifton pushed by William and resumed his fast pace. (end of excerpt)
It was very interesting to learn about the import roles that women had played during the Civil War. Hetty and Jenny Cary were good friends to the Prentiss family and unwavering in their support and loyalty to the Confederacy. Although these ladies were the cream of Baltimore society, it was not uncommon for them to put themselves in harms way by delivering weapons, supplies, or personal letters to the fields of battle.
I am finding that the more I recall about this novel the more I appreciate the writing and research that went into it. I was so surprised by the different battles that were described with such detail. I think my only disadvantage with this novel was that because I have not been familiar with the Civil War previously, a lot of these details went right over my head. I found myself having to read sections over again to be able to comprehend what was being told. 
Obviously political differences was one of the major themes of this novel, but I found it interesting that even during the Civil War, people found ways to get ahead just by knowing someone. Unfortunately, that is still going on today, but I want to share one last excerpt that describes Clifton's frustrations regarding General Ben Butler, who apparently was known as a political General. The following excerpt is taken from page 232:
""More importantly, I have nothing but disdain for anyone who acquires or maintains his position through political power. Butler was the first major general of volunteers appointed by a grateful President Lincoln in May of 1861. That mistake had terrible consquences in terms of unnecessary casualties and opportunities lost. As a field officer, I deplore the high cost paid by the common soldier for the failures of political generals. Thank God I never had to serve directly under one."" (end of excerpt)
I did enjoy this novel, but it did take me a bit longer to read just because everything was so unfamiliar to me. I do think that this is a good thing as I believe that we all should be continually learning. So I want to give a special Thank You to David H. Jones for giving us a story about a family ripped apart by war, but finding their way back to each other.

561,"This volume of letters from Henrietta, a middle aged provincial doctors wife and mother of two grown up children, to her childhood friend Robert, a soldier at the front, chronicles the last three years of the war, from late 1942 to 1945.

Henrietta, Charles and their neighbours; the kindly, good natured elderly widow Lady B, the curt Mrs Savernack, the Colonel and his wife, the Admiral and his wife, the flirtatious Faith and the smitten Conductor, are carrying on as best they can, and Henrietta captures their characters and the often hilarious every day events of life with her usual dry humour.

""Why Do Dogs Bark?"" helps people understand dogs' habits a little bit better. Just like people, dogs can be diverse which means that every dog has their own unique qualities. ""Why Do Dogs Bark?"" helps pin point some of these strange qualities and unique traits that many common, everyday dogs have. It is extremely important for children to understand that everyone and everything is in fact different. Diversity is every where and exposing our children to this known fact will enhance their understanding and acceptance of it as well.

573,"Very clear and engaging explanation of the job of a medical examiner. This book reinforced my faith in some of the crime fiction authors I have read (e.g., Patricia Cornwell and Jeffrey Deaver), because many of the things Dr. Zugibe explained were things I had already read about in the Kay Scarpetta or Lincoln Rhyme novels. Seems like the authors are doing a good job with their homework.
And it seems to be that truth is at least as strange as fiction, if not stranger. There were some fascinating stories in this collection. In general, the perpetrators didn't seem to be quite as hard to pin down in the real-life tales as they sometimes are in fiction.
I also enjoyed the last chapter, although it was a bit of a jolting change of pace. In this section, the Dr. Zugibe gives his strong opinions regarding the bumbling of the investigators and prosecutors in the JonBenet Ramsey and O.J. Simpson cases, and gives a brief, rather random disparagement of the use of psychics in criminal investigation.

It is a compelling story and I had no trouble turning page after page, but the cluttered somewhat clunky writing started getting in the way of my reading enjoyment. Her son is charming and that mother-son relationship is a great piece of the story. There are some great scenes and I was certainly never bored, but I felt like the rest needed a little something.
As with any break-up, its easy for an outsider to pass quick judgment on the situation and I found myself in that very position, frustrated that she wasnt just getting over it already and moving on. One contributing factor was that I just never felt like I got a sense of the weight of the relationship and so found it hard to really feel the heartbreak.

Forty years ago the supernatural creatures were exposed after a genetically engineered virus, hiding in an innocent tomato, killed half the worlds population of humans. Now they exist in an often uneasy truce. Rachel, a witch, is a runner with the Inderland Runner Services, policing supernatural crime throughout Cincinnati. Unfortunately, the calibre of Rachels assignments has vastly decreased recently, and she is fed up. She decides to break her contract with the I.S. and start her own runner agency, scoffing at the rumors of consequences. Thats until she discovers that she has been marked for death and she must find a way to save herself before its too late.
In case you havent noticed by the reviews which are popping up around here, the end of my dissertation was accompanied by some serious light reading. Urban fantasy is an awesome variant, and this book in particular was a pleasant surprise.
First of all, its fairly long and it has an excellent plot, at least I thought so. Once Rachel quits the I.S., it gets going and I really wanted to find out what would happen next. Since shes in constant danger of her life, shes often on the run and dealing with difficult situations. She only makes things worse for herself later on by entangling herself in another dangerous plot. Its a little zany, but it works!
Rachel herself is a character I liked almost immediately. Shes stubborn and doesnt back down, even when she should, but I felt her reasoning was good and her fears were very human. The secondary characters were also fairly well-rounded. Ivy is a dangerous vampire but with a strangely compassionate side. We never really figure out why shes so interested in Rachel and determined to back her up, but that must be a story for one of the next installments. Jenks the pixie is a hilarious sidekick and adds just that much more to the book. The third character, who pops up around the middle, is also a welcome addition to this series.
It was also refreshing to find that there isnt much romance in this installment. I can feel it coming, but Im getting a little tired of romance at the moment and Im looking for something else in my fantasy. This book fit the bill perfectly.
If you like urban fantasy, Dead Witch Walking would be a great addition to your library. Im looking forward to the rest of the series. ",0,1257379200.0,4198,[],littlebookworm,4.0,"Nov 5, 2009",58517,318868,2009-11-05,2009,11,0.0,0.0,2.0

588,"I took my first yoga class when I was twenty-one (so, uh, around eight years ago), and I've been hooked on it ever since. Back then, I remember being struck by how ""free"" I felt when I practiced, and how yoga made it easy for me to turn off that constant inner-monologue. Yoga allowed me to feel happier and more present. 
Since moving up North (and far away from any yuppie yoga studios), I've tried to practice at least several times as week (either in the basement or on the balcony). I've also expanded my own views on yoga through dvds, magazines, and books. I've become more liberated and self-assured, along with being more flexible (although, I honestly feel that I'll never ever be able to do a decent cow face). 
In brief, I feel like my relationship with yoga is still constantly evolving and changing - this is a good thing.
As previously stated, I try to learn as much as possible about yoga. I have books upon books about the varying styles of yoga, and I still get excited to read something new. I recently read Alan Finger's Chakra Yoga: Balancing Energy for Physical, Spiritual, and Mental Well-Being. Finger's style of yoga, ISHTA yoga, concentrates of usage of physical practice to stimulate the seven chakras. Through asanas, meditation, and chanting, Finger believes that it is possible for one to create positive energy and to balance the chakras.
Personally, I loved this book. Yep, this book is FANTASTIC!
I found Finger's writing style to be easily understood, and I liked how Finger ties personal experiences with his ideas. As a reader, these personal touches make the book to be an engaging spiritual text rather than a heavy philosophical tome. Finger should be applauded for adding important details on how each pose should be done and including pictures of said poses. Far too often yoga books include poses, but have little details on the finer nature of these poses. Alignment is important! Finally, I found that his daily chakra practices could be easily incorporated into my own routine, and really do feel that these practices have also furthered my feeling of contentment.
Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced student of yoga, I recommend that you check this book out. The practices in here will only help to enhance your practice! ",0,1303948800.0,1763975,[],wenzowsa,4.5,"Apr 28, 2011",81482,198617,2011-04-28,2011,4,0.0,0.0,2.25

The third in the Vampire Huntress series, this book was a lot longer than the other books, with a more intricate plot. I did enjoy the book  the story is getting interesting, but I found the length a bit daunting at times (and Im not intimidated by long books; I just need them to really engage me). I felt like I was reading and reading and reading, and not really making much progress  the book didnt grab me and pull me in like some books do. On the plus side, though, I didnt find the use of slang as distracting in this book. I dont know if shes cut back on it, or if Ive just gotten used to it. This book has some pretty steamy sex scenes, too, although in a way, I found the romantic aspects almost oppressive. There is a LOT of angst going on here, for a number of characters. Which, in one way, is interesting, but I did find it almost too much at times.

Kommissarie Guido Brunetti r dock av en annan sikt och det drjer inte lnge innan han har ftt upp spret efter den verklige mrdaren. Han mste dock vara frsiktig fr att inte vcka vreden hos sina verordnade som gr allt fr att stta kppar i hjulet fr honom och hans nrmaste medarbetare.
Egentligen r Donna Leons deckare tmligen intetsgande och tempofattiga. Men jag lskar dem nd. Dels lskar jag Italien som r ett land jag aldrig kan f nog av, dels har Donna Leon en skn mix (eller kanske r det versttarens frtjnst?) mellan vanligt sprk och italienska fraser som gr att jag fr ett fnigt leende p lpparna emellant.
Men det r lngt ifrn allt!
ven om jag sjlv inte rankar Venedig srskilt hgt kan jag nd inte lta bli att dras med i atmosfren som Donna Leon mlar upp i sina bcker. Venedig r en av de skitigaste stder jag ngonsin har beskt men efter att ha lst en bok av henne knner jag mig p ngot konstigt stt som en frlskad tonring. Hon avleder lsaren frn Venedigs mindre charmanta knnetecken (frutom korruption och andra intrikata hndelser som utgr en bas i hennes intriger) fr att i stllet plocka fram den charm som faktiskt finns dr under den ngot smutsiga ytan. Till och med Brunettis promenader genom de trnga grnderna lter som ljuv musik och nr han tar en bt (Vaporetto) fr att frflytta sig mellan de misstnktas/vittnenas bostder fylls jag av en eufori som r nst intill omjlig att beskriva i ord.
Som sig br har Venedig en egen dialekt och det terkommer Leon till vid ett flertal tillfllen i Falska bevis. Nyfiken som jag r var jag tvungen att ta reda p om jag ver huvud taget skulle frst ngonting av Venetianska och jag blev positivt verraskad. Eller snarare, i skrift har jag inga problem att hnga med men jag r sker p att om jag skulle st ga mot ga med en venetianare skulle jag nog be honom/henne att verg till italienska tmligen omgende. Det r kul med dialekter men jag r glad om de hller sig utanfr litteraturens vrld.
Huvudpersonen i Leons bcker heter som sagt Guido Brunetti och det gr absolut inte att tycka illa om honom. Han str upp fr de svaga i samhllet. Han gr emot sina chefer nr nden s krver. Han tar vl hand om sina anstllda och han vnder andra kinden till nr Elettra tar sig in i diverse system fr att hmta uppgifter hon egentligen inte har befogenhet att handha. Allt fr att stta den rttfrdige brottslingen bakom ls och bom. Dessutom har han en gudomlig fru och tv underbara barn och nr de alla r samlade utgr de urtypen ver hur en krnfamilj ska se ut och de visar att det gr att leva i perfekt harmoni. Usch, nu blev det lite vl smrigt ven fr min smak drfr ska vi skyndsamt g ver till Leons absoluta styrka.
Att skriva en recension av Donna Leons bcker utan att nmna maten som konstant retar smaklkarna sida upp och sida ner vore ingenting annat n tjnstefel! Jag menar nr en s enkel rtt som Pasta med olio e peperoncino gr att snlvattnet fullstndigt rinner ver d har men som frfattare verkligen lyckats f ver en s anti gourmet som jag faktiskt r p sin sida.

600,"Richard Florida, whose books including ""The Rise of the Creative Class"" consistently document what he believes to be the growing influence of that class, returns in his latest work with a recession-era manifesto suggesting ways we can work together to foster that class and engage in a major reset of how we work and prosper. We are living through an even more powerful and fundamental economic shift, from an industrial system to an economy that is increasingly powered by knowledge, creativity, and ideas, he suggests (p. 111), so we need to respond to peoples desire to learn, to develop new competencies, and to grow their capacity and confidence, through training and development and through promotion from within (p. 121).
Drawing from and acknowledging the work of writers including Jane Jacobs (""The Economy of Cities"") and Lewis Mumford (""The City in History"") to talk about the importance of communities and subcommunities, he looks at the role technology and infrastructure play in developing and nurturing communities (p. 21) and envisions a resurgence driven by community groups and citizen-led initiatives rather than from top-down policies imposed by local governments (p. 82).
 
The great news for those of us involved in workplace learning and performance is that education and training, according to Florida, are key elements in this process: When the mills closed in the 1970s and 1980s, people in Pittsburgh went out and got training and college degreesa collective action that he and others cite as part of the reason for Pittsburghs Reset successes (p. 78). As he concludes his survey of how we have dealt with past economic crises and suggests ways to nurture the creativity he believes is essential to our success, he ties his various themes together: Education and infrastructure, creativity, and connectivitythese are things we can address, things we must improve and ensure to see this Reset through and build a new prosperity (p. 186).

Teens not sure of whats going on? Check. Genetic mutations? Check. Historical mystery to thicken the plot? Check. This book started slow but once it picked up I was hooked!
Samantha has rippled a couple of times but has no clue what it means or if shes losing her mind. Who can just turn invisible? No one she knows so she must be going crazy. Then, she ripples while out on the water and a boy name Will sees and knows whats happening to her...
As Will and his sister try to explain to Sam what they know about her condition, they continue receiving mystery letters offering safety but what really floored me was Sam reading journal entries by a doctor from the World War II era. The journal entries are morbid and sinister and involve experiments with children being forced to choose between kindness and survival. Not only that, Sam finds out that the accident that killed her mother and best friend wasnt one after all and that SHE was the intended target. It also seems that everyone with the rippler gene is disappearing, but why?
An enjoyable first read for a series. Id like to know a little more about how Will and Sam were drawn together in the first place so Ill be waiting for book two! ",0,1319932800.0,11428291,[],RtB,4.0,"Oct 30, 2011",22724,57215,2011-10-30,2011,10,0.0,0.0,2.0

615,"This book was a mixed bag for me. The historical details and explanations were amazingly detailed and accurate, but this did lead to several moments of info dump where the reader is told rather than shown, and that did cause the plot to lag. While I appreciate the depth of research into several elements, providing so much information and managing the intertwining stories of the 3 generationally distanced female characters required several moments where I had to stop and contemplate who was where, and what was happening. I also found myself stopping or struggling with conversations, particularly moments where dialog was being written with the attempt at an accent. This is a particular gripe of mine: if you find a need to write an accent or patois into a characters conversation, understand that many readers will find that difficult to process. Unfortunately there were particular characters that were bordering on caricature in their conversation, I do think an editor should have questioned that continued inclusion. 
When the story was moving forward, it was quite engaging and there were so many different elements coming into play: action, romance, old grudges and mythology. Keeping it all straight from a plotting perspective is a Herculean task, and the effort was evident. For me, however, the sheer volume of information to process made this a good, not great read.

The key to building a superior company, an increasing number of observers now agree, is the ongoing ability to recruit and retain superior personnel. In Topgrading, industrial psychologist and global consultant Bradford Smart expands upon this idea by examining in great detail exactly how today's premier organizations have assembled such top-level employees, and then showing precisely how others can do it, too. ""Simply put, topgrading is the practice of packing the team with A players and clearing out the C players,"" Smart writes. ""'A players' is defined as the top 10 percent of talent available at all salary levels--best of class. With this radical definition, you are not a topgrader until your team consists of all A players. Period."" Essentially a best-practices manual for developing this outstanding personnel pool, the book is based on more than 4,000 interviews and case studies conducted by Smart at major corporations like General Electric as well as fast-growing high-tech companies and small family-owned firms. He further bolsters its effectiveness by including his extensive ""Chronological In-Depth Structured Interview Guide,"" along with other assessment tools and hands-on strategies for assembling an ideal work team. --Howard Rothman

620,"Life on the tiny island of Guernsey has just become a whole lot harder for fifteen-year-old Cat Rozier. Shes gone from model pupil to murderer, but she swears its not her fault. Apparently its all the fault of history.
A new arrival at Cats high school in 1984, the beautiful and instantly popular Nicolette inexplicably takes Cat under her wing. The two become inseparablegoing to parties together, checking out boys, and drinking whatever liquor they can shoplift. But a perceived betrayal sends them spinning apart, and Nic responds with cruel, over-the-top retribution.
Cats recently deceased father, Emile, dedicated his adult life to uncovering the truth about the Nazi occupation of Guernseyfrom Churchills abandonment of the island to the stories of those who resistedin hopes of repairing the reputation of his older brother, Charlie. Through Emiles letters and Charlies wordsrecorded on tapes before his own death a confession takes shape, revealing the secrets deeply woven into the fabric of the island . . . and into the Rozier family story.
I really wanted to love this book. It had an interesting premise and takes place on Guernsey Island, a place I have been fascinated with since reading The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.
I found Cat interesting and that we find out right at the beginning that Cat kills Nic. However, it kind of goes downhill from there. The story is very fractured as it moves from Cat's story to that of her father and uncle. I don't mind an alternating story, but this wasn't done very well. I wouldn't get far into either story before it would switch and it just didn't hold my interest.
I did enjoy the history of the island and I think that it this could have been a great novel. But it was mediocre at best despite it's potential. Hopefully, the author will have better luck with her next book.

622,"I had two customers at the bookshop asking for this book in the last week or so, which often happens if it's recently been featured on the radio. The second customer, a sweet little old lady, fell into a tone of deep reverence and told me it was 'lovely, just lovely - I knew I needed to have a copy!' Well, happily for me, I have a copy, so I searched it out and read it straight away!
The back of this edition says that 'The Snow Goose' is 'a beautiful tale of a hunchbacked artist, a girl, a wounded bird and a courageous act at Dunkirk.' It being a short story, there really isn't much I can add to that without ruining it. All I can say is that my customer was right - it is lovely. From the first page it resounded with poetry and bravery, deep sadness and a profound love and respect for the natural world. By the end I was in tears and absolutely certain that this book wouldn't be leaving my shelves any time soon.
The second story, 'The Small Miracle', is a modern fable about a poor orphaned Italian boy, Pepino, and his quest to save his best friend and only remaining family, his beloved donkey Violetta. She is very sick, and his only chance is to get her into the crypt of his local church at Assisi for St. Francis to heal her. Again, it's a very moving story - orphan boy, sick donkey, here come the tears again! - and it's woven through with an appealing atmosphere of innocence and faith.
For me, the first story will be unforgettable; the second story less so, but still far surpassing every other short story I have ever read, at least as far as my memory serves!

I'm getting kind of tired of this ploy, especially since Siege wasn't all that great in the first place.
I did like seeing the Sentry's ""real"" background, finally, which was kind of along the lines of what I thought it would be. And Noh-Varr is an interesting character; I hope to see more of him. And I like how sadistic Bullseye is; I just can't help it.

624,"Christine Lucas suffers from a rare form of amnesia as the result of a vaguely defined accident. Each night as she sleeps, her near-term memory is wiped clean, and she awakens knowing little about who she is, where she is, or with whom she lives. Every day her husband, Ben, shares with her the same carefully rehearsed story of their long marriage and gently encourages her struggle to remember. She keeps a journal at the recommendation of her doctor and reads it each morning. As the journal grows, Christine begins to suspect that Ben is not telling her the complete truth about her accident, their son Adam, her successful career as a novelist, or the fire that destroyed the collection of family photos that might help her remember.

With its simple premise and transparent plot, Before I Go To Sleep would translate well to the screen. Think of Audrey Hepburns film Wait Until Dark. But at 360 pages, the story became somewhat tedious to me onceI had solved the mystery approximately halfway through.
Writing is Mr. Watsons second career. His debut novel shows well: his characters have personalities and the narrative has a quality of elegance about it. I would be interested in historical fiction from this author or a fictional memoir which would lend itself to Mr. Watsons dilatory storytelling.

Review: This book is an example of a folk tale. It was a story that has been passed down and retold in this book. The story tells of a peasant (Big Anthony) who is ordinary and a ""witch"" who has a magic pot that creates pasta. The reader is able to identify right (not touching the pot) from wrong (touching the pot and creating chaos by the actions of Big Anthony and the warning by Strega Nona. There is a moral of the story which is to listen to instruction and follow direction, not try to show off, or things will happen that are not intended.
Characterization: Big Anthony is a flat character because you do not know much about him in the beginning of the story, and you do not know much more about him by the end. However he is a dynamic character because he goes from following rules to breaking the rules and learning from his mistakes.

628,"Young Maida Westabrook had almost everything that a little girl could desire, from a doting father and kind care-givers, to every luxury - toys, books, exotic pets, her very own automobile - that money could buy. A chronic invalid who had only recently learned to walk, what she lacked was good health, a sense of purpose and/or enthusiasm, and companions of her own age. Hoping to address this, her father, millionaire Jerome ""Buffalo"" Westabrook, bought her the tiny candy and toy shop that she had admired in passing, and set her up as its proprietress. Now the wealthy Beacon Hill girl found herself living - under the careful supervision of Granny Flynn, her Irish nurse, and of newspaperman Billy Potter, a close confidante of her father - in the working-class area of Boston known as Charlestown. Here she made her first real friends, from lame Dicky Dore, who needed help with his reading, to wild Rosie Brine, who loved animals and hated bullies. Even those for whom she initially had little friendly feeling - snobby Laura Lathrop, sullen Arthur Duncan - eventually come into her circle of influence...
Originally published in 1910, <u>Maida's Little Shop</u> is the first entry in Inez Haynes Irwin's fifteen-volume series chronicling the adventures of the eponymous Maida Westabrook and her friends. With a charming heroine, an engaging cast of secondary figures - I particularly loved Rosie, as well as naughty toddler Betsy Hale - and an unusual and entertaining premise that allows for a mix of characters that might not otherwise have been possible, it was a pleasant story to read. I will definitely be searching out subsequent installments in the series! As a friend noted in her own online review this is the common childhood fantasy of ""playing shop"" writ large. It is also a fascinating social document, offering a snapshot of both progressive and paternalistic notions about socio-economic class abroad in the culture at the time of its publication. I found myself thinking, as I read along, that those readers who objected to the ""poverty tourism"" in Barbara Ehrenreich's <u>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America</u> would undoubtedly have a field day here, in the unlikely event that they were ever to pick this book up. For my part, I thought Irwin's depiction of cross-cultural and cross-class friendships was unusually sensitive, especially when compared to some of the other children's literature available at the time, and in earlier years. One of the few sour notes for me, in Louisa May Alcott's classic <u>Little Women</u> (a personal favorite), was the brief reference to the March girls being ""enemies"" with all the local Irish children, who are clearly seen as interlopers. There is no sense of that here, as Maida becomes intimate friends with the children of Primrose Court, many of whom are of Irish extraction. I was also impressed by the fact that Maida's relationship with her new friends is reciprocal - that Maida gets as much out of the bargain as she puts in. There is no ""rich-girl getting to be the good-fairy"" here, as Maida herself discovers when she offers her shop to the members of the WMNT club for their fair, only to realize that they will not accept because they don't wish to be beholden to her. Although poor, these children have their pride, and Maida's realization that this is something to be respected, is an important step toward equality, rather than kindly meant but paternalistic (maternalistic?) benevolence.
I'm curious to see what happens next with these characters, and whether Irwin continues to offer such an unusually nuanced depiction of her working class (and upper class) characters!

Ally is a master at playing the piano. She has been taking lessons since she was four. She is now thirteen. She takes lessons from one of the most talented teachers in New York City at the pre-college program at Juilliard.
You have to audition to get into the program, and to stay in the program you have to live and breathe music. She needs to practice at least six hours a day, and she goes to lessons during the week and all day on Saturdays. Her teacher wants her to quit her public school and be home-schooled so she will have even more time to practice.
Ally isn't buying this anymore. She realizes that she is missing out on being a kid. She wants to spend a Saturday hanging out with her best friend and her almost-boyfriend. But her parents are into music, too. Her dad makes his living playing the violin and her mother sings. They don't want her to give up her dream.
Ally is confused and doesn't know what she wants to do. She has a love of music but she also has a love of mathematics. The story in FOUR SEASONS is not lighthearted. This tale tells about how stressed kids can be who are over-programmed in life, and how that stress can cause many problems for them. I really enjoyed this book and hope that many others will, too.

634,"There's a tense beginning and then (true to the jacket blurb) the murders keep coming in a creepy old castle. Ann Morven's powerful writing sustains the grim stuff while giving us chuckles too. I would say the best thing about this author is that she is always entertaining.
This is one of a series of whodunits featuring an Australian folksinger with the queer name of Sheil B. Wright. She always seems to find time to sing while bumbling along the murder trail. Here she warbles songs linked to Bonnie Prince Charlie, whose giant tapestry portrait plays a vital role in the plot.
The riddles are not all to do with Scottish culture, because visiting the Highlands with one of his wives is an officer from Malaysia's Moral Police Force.
All the characters are larger than life and I see Morven's Yankee Tycoon as a bit of a stereotype hard to swallow. Nevertheless, I give this five stars. It's a great read. ",0,1358640000.0,13423427,[],Cathymacleod,5.0,"Jan 20, 2013",5211,143933,2013-01-20,2013,1,0.0,0.0,2.5
635,"I love books about the British social classes, so of course this story about a woman who marries for the status she will receive when she becomes a member of her husband's upper crust family was right down my alley. I particularly enjoyed the way in which Fellowes wrote his story. He wanted the reader to understand the way in which the titled British elite think of themselves and others. His explanations of the etiquette and behavior of those who have vs those who have not were often amusing and certainly entertaining. However, Fellowes did not lose sight of the fact that an entire class of people honestly do live as those he describes in this novel, and that they have problems and the occasional moral dilemma just like the rest of us do. In this particular case, a woman has to decide how she will spend what she knows will be a boring life no matter what choices she makes for herself. While there may be humor in how seriously the gentry takes itself, for this particular woman there's also a bit of sadness that envelopes her painfully shallow life. Because I enjoy this kind of story and this particular subject, it was hard for me to put the book down; but I believe <b>Snobs</b> has a good enough story to appeal to anyone who wants to read about how ""the other half"" lives.

640,"Sebastian Faulks, author, of ""Birdsong"" and ""A Week in December"" among other works of both fiction and nonfiction, has written a set of five sketches of individual lives in his latest work of fiction, ""A Possible Life"". The idea that the title suggests a singular life and there are five lives depicted in the novel possibly suggests that these lives are connected in some nuanced and subtle ways that is not immediately apparent. In turn, the subtitle is ""A Novel in Five Parts"" further leads one to the same possibility. 
 The first in the set of novellas is Greg Talbot (1938) who finds himself leaving his safe teaching position for the life of espionage in occupied France. Next is Billy (1859) in Victorian England who finds himself sent by his family to an orphanage and struggles to overcome this bleak childhood. Billy is followed by Elena (2029) who as a child removes herself from much of human interaction but later becomes a pioneering and famous scientist. Jeanne (1822) is living in rural France as a maid and nursemaid and Anya (1971) struggles with a difficult childhood to become a famous but troubled singer/songwriter.
Faulks is a consummate and masterful storyteller and each life study seems capable of being a separate novel it and of itself. At first it appears that there is no obvious thread and certainly no time sequence to the life stories presented by Faulks. But as you read each successive story, it becomes more apparent that each separate individual life story has to deal with tragedies, loss and grief, separation and alienation and continue to search for attachment and purpose. The historical context and individual personalities vary and are diverse but the underlying arc of a life set against change and uncertainty powerfully presents itself in each story. This is truly a profound novel that continues to resonate well after you finish the final and is certainly one worth going back to in the future.

'We call the planet Eurydice. The star  we don't have a name for it. We know it is in the Sagittarius Arm.
'No shit!' Carlyle grinned with unfeigned delight. 'We didn't know the skein stretched this far.'
'Skein?'
She waved her hands. 'That wormhole, it's linked to lots of others in a sort of messy tangle.'
He stared at her' his teeth playing on his lower lip.
'And you and your colleagues came here through the wormhole?'
'Of course.' She wrapped her arms around herself while the thermal elements in the undersuit warmed up. 'You didn't know this was a gate?'
Armand shook his head. 'We've always kept clear of the alien structure' for reasons which should be obvious, but apparently are not.' He pointed a finger; the sweep of his hand indicated the horizon, and the hilltop henges. 'We took the circle of megaliths to be a boundary indicator, left by the indigenes. Today is the first time in a century that anyone has set foot within it. We keep it under continuous surveillance, of course, which is why your intrusion was detected. That and the signal burst. It went off like a goddamn nuclear EMP, but that's the least of the damage.' He glared at her. 'Something for which you will pay, whoever you are. What did you say you were?'
'The Carlyles,' she reiterated, proudly and firmly.
'And who're they, when they're at home?'
She was unfamiliar with the idiom. 'We're at home everywhere,' she said. 'People have a name for the wormhole skein. They call it Carlyle's Drift.'
This is an enjoyable space opera, but overall I found it a bit confusing. There is a lot going on and things like the political differences between the Returners and Reformers were never explained clearly enough. The implications of backing yourself up on a regular basis so that you could be resurrected if you died were touched upon, but never resolved. Now as she sat in the monorail shuttle facing the Armands and holding her knees together to stop their trembling, she felt the same horror. James Winter and Alan Calder were not uploads or downloads, or even resurrectees. They had prosthetic personalities. They had false memories. Without reliable human memory there could be no identity, no continuity, no humanity. The idea affected her like motion sickness. Although Lucinda was panicked when she discovered that Winter and Calder had been resurrected from the little that remained of their brains after they died in a car crash with their missing memories reconstructed from information about them that was held on computer, she soon convinced herself that there wasn't any problem after all. Even though when the resurrected Lucinda read a letter her dying self had written to her, she could tell that the original Lucinda was different, having been changed by the experiences she underwent after her last back-up.
The conclusion appears to be that 'memories maketh the man'. If you see yourself as a person then you are one, whether you are alive for the first time or have been resurrected from a back-up, whether you are a back-up of a real person living in a virtual reality, or a construct of a human being living in that same virtual reality. But in my opinion, although Lucinda #2 may think she is the same person as Lucinda #1, seeing them both as one continuous Lucinda, Lucinda #1 is dead and gone, to an afterlife, reincarnation or nothingness. There is no continuity of Lucinda-consciousness for her.
Don't you find it annoying when the person who wrote the back cover blurb has obviously not read the book. ""Lucinda Carlyle, head of an ambitious clan of galactic entrepreneurs, had carved out a profitable niche for herself and her kin by taking control of the Skein, a chain of interplanetary star-gates left behind by the posthumans. But on a world called Eurydice, a remote planet at the farthest rim of the galaxy, Lucinda stumbled upon a forgotten relic of the past that could threaten her way of life."" If they had read even the first chapter, they would have known that Lucinda is not the head of the Carlyles; she is a youngster of 24 and the mission to Eurydice is her first as team leader of a squad of combat archaeologists.

Review originally posted at Romancing the Book
I had a harder time buying into this story than most. Here we have two long-time friends, both hot for each other, but neither will act on it for fear of losing a friend. So instead, they dance around the attraction issue and make up excuses for why they arent making a play for each other. Neither man is in a relationship and this isnt an ugly-duckling story, where one man feels hes not good enough for the other, so I just didnt understand the hesitation. As for the characters themselves, I found them to be real and even likable.
Pete, a talented tattoo artist, strives to please his Uncle Teddy, who also happens to be his boss and the only family member who backed up his art career. I found it odd that Pete knows next to nothing about Teddy, the same uncle that took him under his wing and is training him to take over the tattoo shop. Pete is what I term in-between  in-between the young party years and the grown-up, settling down years. While he still heads out for drinks and dancing at the end of a work day, it seems to be wearing on him. He seems ready to move on to the next phase of his life  the permanent relationship. But hes also in-between in his work. Pete knows hes quite talented as an artist, but hes afraid to put his art on display in a competition, fearing he wont come in first.
Chris is more straightforward, if a bit of a mystery. He has decided on what he wants and then decides to get it. And that begins with a kiss and a barter with Peter. Its the kiss that leads them to explore their attraction to one another, but we dont really learn much about Chris until the end of the book and that seems a shame. We know he wants Pete, but thats about all we know. I would have like more insight into Chris past, into what hes doing now and why hes doing it.
Despite my initial misgivings, the story itself is a good, quick read. Its simply about the attraction of two men and how they overcome their hesitations of commitment. ",0,1364688000.0,12903654,[],RtB,3.0,"Mar 31, 2013",22724,122280,2013-03-31,2013,3,0.0,0.0,1.5

Science journalist Nicholas Wade has delivered an exploration of human genetics in the spirit of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel. Wade works backwards in time, using genetic clues to discover knowledge about prehistoric human societies. Before the Dawn offers a breadth of knowledge about current genetic research into human populations and migrations, and draws some fascinating conclusions about the rise and dispersal of early human societies.
Wade's narrative largely follows research into genetic variations found in the Y chromosome and in mitochondrial DNA. These variations, the distribution of which allows researchers to track common ancestry and branching, are used to narrow the likely periods of human movement out of Africa to points beyond. A bit of time is spent on the earliest culturally modern humans in Africa before moving on latter periods of migration and settlement. Potential interactions with hominid relatives is discussed, as is the impact of various cold spells and ice ages.
Wade explores social behavior as well, showing how researchers have applied darwinian natural selection and genetic drift to account for both universal and isolated behaviors. Later, language is considered, with significant caveats as to its effectiveness in signalling fundamental shifts in human population. The discussion on race is well crafted. Wade does not bow to social pressure in describing genetic variations found among the races, including a fascinating discussion of the intellectual prowess of Ashkenazi Jews. Just to be clear, Wade is not advocating superiority of any race, he wants only to point out that there are significant data indicating genetic differences of isolated human populations can produce measurably different abilities.
I found Before the Dawn to be fascinating, and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Pulitzer Prize-winning Guns, Germs, and Steel. Wade may not be a scientist, but he has conducted a thorough investigation into the ongoing research of population genetics and offers the reader a tremendous treat of science and history.

I was into this book from the beginning, but then I was really into it when Professor Alexi came into it. It was as though he was a piece of my own soul.
The supernatural plot line was a little confusing. I wasn't sure of the exact motives behind the greater forces at work. I'm hoping that more will be explained in the second book. I also feel like I should have paid better attention at the very beginning when the prophecy was given, as that is a key part of the book.

The basic premise is that Twoflower, a tourist with perhaps the most dangerous luggage in existence, has wandered into the twin cities of Ankh and Morpork. While there, he meets and hires the failed wizard Rincewind as a guide. As a wizard, Rincewind knows only one spell, though he's not sure what spell and it could mean the end of the world if he were to say it (who knows?). Catastrophe ensues, starting with the twin cities burning down. Rincewind can't catch a break, but it seems he's destined to watch out for Twoflower, mostly because the luggage threatens to swallow him whole if he doesn't.

In this case, the cover was the little display copy of this book, light pink with a cupcake complete with a little death's-head ornament on it, and the thought was of my friend Kit, who recently moved to town and is allergic to around 3/4 of everything under the sun, it seems. Beasley's book promised tales of life from someone with just about as many allergies as Kit has, along with some scientific discussion of how allergies work, and why they seem to perhaps be increasing.
On the whole, this was indeed a cute and fast read. The little looks in at the science of how allergens work and set off terrible reactions, why some allergens are classed together, and the social and political implications of how people deal with allergies and the rising awareness thereof were interesting, although I could probably have used a bit more detail on some of it. But you do get a good taste for the way it works and how people are trying to deal with it. The amount of legislation in place, and awareness in restaurants and among common folk, has definitely increased.
But that said, if you're as allergic as Beasley, the world still has a ways to go, and the most interesting parts of the book are really the tales of her life and trying to deal with it. For most of her allergies, they're very severe; her dairy and egg allergies, for example, meant that if someone ate cake at a birthday party for her, and kissed her on the cheek after, she'd get hives. A knife being used to cut cheese, and then her salad, is enough to make her curl up and gasp for air. Much of the story tells of how her parents had to deal with her, the choices she makes to avoid using Epi-pens and just suffer through as much as possible, still trying to navigate relationships with friends and her boyfriend where she's careful, but still trying to live life as full as possible. Just all the realms in which her family and then she have to be cautious, because a tiny slip means a whole lot of misery, definitely get described and communicated well.
It's still a light and fast read, though, and you'll come away with a new appreciation of what it means to be highly allergic to food (and other objects), even if it's not directly applicable to you or those close to you. That's not always the point of reading though, is it? I liked the style well enough, and it was enjoyable, if not particularly memorable. If you're interested in the topic, it won't take you long to read through, and you'll probably like it fine. It does have some catchy bits... and it makes you glad that the allergies themselves aren't among them. ",0,1348531200.0,10793565,[],Capfox,4.0,"Sep 25, 2012",4882,30625,2012-09-25,2012,9,0.0,0.0,2.0

661,"Banks, K. (2007). Lenny's space. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
Grades 4 through 7
Nine-year-old Lenny has a hard time dealing with others. His mind is always working, and he cannot control the urge when one of his thoughts wants to come out. He is often found in the principals office because of his outbursts. At home, his single mother tries her best to work with Lenny, but sometimes he can read frustration in her expressions and words. When he is referred to Muriel, the school psychologist, Lenny learns to get in touch with his emotions and control his impulses. He finds a friend in Van, a seven-year-old with leukemia, and experiences the joys and pain of getting close to someone else. When Van does not survive his disease, Lenny has to face issues long buriedbeing abandoned by his father, losing his grandfather, and allowing his emotions to finally come to the surface. He learns to communicate his feelings and becomes closer to those whom he loves.
Lenny's space brings to light the wonders and difficulties of living with a disability. Banks portrayal of Lenny provides the reader with a close look at the mind of a child with Asperger Syndrome. As he works with Muriel, the school psychologist, Lenny learns to control his behavior and express his feelingsespecially when it comes to loss. Very real situations such as growing up without a father, learning to accept new people into the family circle, and losing those whom one loves are dealt with honesty and respect. This is a great reading selection to teach tolerance and to represent children with disabilities into the curriculum. Vans death can be upsetting to younger readers, but it opens the doors to discussion about death and loss. Teachers looking to enlarge students personal points of view will find in Lennys space a plethora of topics to explore. Children with disabilities will feel empowered that their experiences are present in the classroom in such a realistic and touching way.

662,"This is my first Deb Caletti, and it makes me wonder why on earth I waited so long to pick up one of her books. It was a really enjoyable book, and I can tell that Caletti is a very talented writer. That being said, it fell a little flat for me.
Let's start with Indigo, the main character. She's supposed to be eighteen. The book starts at the end of her senior year. I really didn't see her as eighteen. At times she was older, at times she was younger. She could be extremely observant, cynical, and wiser than her years at times, especially in the beginning, but she could be whiny, dense, and unable to see her own life at others, towards the end. I definitely liked her better in the beginning, when she was just a normal girl with a normal waitress job and a normal boyfriend. That was interesting to me, her life and the people in it.
Then, near the halfway point, she suddenly gets 2.5 million dollars. Which WHOA is a lot of money. I mean, what do you DO with all of that money? Well, the rest of the book is about that: what Indigo does with the money and how she handles it. Except that felt false to me. I had a hard time believing that as soon as Indigo got money she turned into this whiny ten year old. That she would blow it on things like a singing soap dispenser. I don't know, maybe it's because that's definitely not how I would handle it, so I had a hard time believing that anyone would act like that.
The first half of the book I really enjoyed, the second half, not so much. Overall Indigo was a good main character, but at times I just wanted to smack her over the head. It wasn't a bad book by any means, just not as good as it could have been. ",0,1268697600.0,4448834,[],book_worm127,3.0,"Mar 16, 2010",34447,327305,2010-03-16,2010,3,0.0,0.0,1.5

666,"This is a wonderful book and not just for lovers of travel. Edward Lear, renowned for his nonsense verse and his exquisite water colours came to Crete in 1864 and this beautiful volume records his travels and experiences in Crete. Lear came to Crete after a long and loving sojourn in Corfu.
First let me deal with the book qua book. The copy I have is a particularly fine production that was published in Athens in the 'Romiosyni Series' (studies and translations in the field of modern Greek culture). I quote from an entry on Abebooks : ""Full brown cloth, illus. blocked in gilt to front board; 117pp.; illus. bw. drawings/tipped-in col. plates"". This a truly handsome book that is lovely to behold and grand to hold. The illustrations are Lear's own work and are beautiful (BTW when they say tipped in it indicates that the illustrations are printed separately from the book itself and are effectively glued onto the pages. There are intruguing sketches, gorgeous watercolours and, amusing cartoons scattered throughout the text which is quarto in format. It also includes a map, a glossary, and an index. What more could one want in a travel book? 
The text is adapted from Lear's handwritten journal and at least one page of his actual journal is reproduced. Lear managed to arrive in Crete during a particularly wet and cold April and stayed until May and while the weather improved during his stay it clearly influenced his opinions and they are also coloured by comparison to his beloved Corfu. For all of the negative taint Lear still finds the people unremittingly kind and generous, if dirty and odorous. The landscapes and the crops - such as he can see them - leave him largely unimpressed but for a modern reader comparing the historic landscapes and the current is enlightening. I, for one, had never realised or noticed that the olive trees at the westernmost end of the island are stunted but, on close inspection, it holds true to this day. Some Cretophiles I have spoken with found Lear's somewhat disparaging descriptions a barrier to enjoying this magnificent volume but I had no such problem. I love this book and will recommend it to anyone and everyone. ",0,1211846400.0,1993044,[],papalaz,4.0,"May 27, 2008",67419,214011,2008-05-27,2008,5,0.0,0.0,2.0

668,"Jane Austen's Sewing Box explores the Regency Period crafts mentioned in the novels of Jane Austen. Craft work was integral to women's lives at the time, and so is referred to frequently in all of her writing. A knowledgeable yet entertaining introduction explains the perception of women and their role in society of the time. The sewing of clothes and manchester for themselves, male relatives and impoverished neighbours was known as 'women's work', and every respectable woman was to be seen with a work basket prominently placed in the home. 'Fancy work', as decorative embroidery was then known, was an acceptable activity to perform in front of guests, and allowed a woman to show off her skill and wealth - having the leisure time to work on unnecessary items was a sign of status in society. There is also a section on materials used at the time and how they were made, which is indispensible for anyone wishing to make truly authentic period pieces.
There are 18 projects, covering sewing, knitting, netting, glass painting, and papercraft, all of which are based on actual craft projects or handmade items mentioned in Jane Austen's novels. An introduction to each one, with quotes from Austen's writing, explains the item's context in womens' daily life. The projects are rated Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced, and those that contain mixed crafts (e.g. sewing and embroidery) are specified. Some projects, such as the Cravat or Muff, are not very practical and would appeal more to an enthusiast of the period. Others, like the Embroidered Work Bag or the Huswife (a pouch for keeping sewing tools in) would be very handy even today. 
The first thing that struck me about this book was how beautifully designed it was. Period wallpaper and fabric designs border every page. The liberal full-page close-up photographs of furniture details and luscious coloured fashion plates could be construed as filler, but to me it had the effect of immersing me in the aesthetic of the time. 
The second thing that struck me was the vagueness of the instructions. They're accompanied by hand-drawn diagrams, but not every step is illustrated. There are very few templates; instead we are told to cut a rectangle with an oval at the top 10cm high, for example. Personally, if I had to hand-draw that myself, it would look rather wonky. Some of the embroidery patterns require enlarging on a photocopier, whereas they would have easily fitted into the book at life size. To me, this detracts from the authentic historical feel of the creative process. 
Despite the fact that some projects are labelled Beginner, I would not feel confident at all following the instructions if I had never tried that craft before. I have never done netting for example, and even though there are diagrams, I found myself at a loss. Perhaps it's a case where it would all fit together once I started, but I don't like working that way. By and large, the finished projects are photographed with either artistic blurring or from an odd angle or both, which make them of no use for the struggling crafter needing a visual reference. There are also a few errors - in Paper Flowers, for example, the materials list includes ribbon, which is not actually used in the construction. 
Regardless of these flaws, I found Jane Austen's Sewing Box a delight. The mixture of history lesson and literature appreciation is highly readable, and I'm very enthusiastic about trying some of the projects, even if they do need a bit of nutting out. The Carpetwork Cushion (aka Tapestry work or Needlepoint) caught my eye in particular, and I think I need about 10 Huswives. I have a sudden urge for everything in my life to be floral.

674,"My 1982 Collins English dictionary does not have the word <b>mankey</b>. Nor does the Macquarie Dictionary. James Baldwin describes Florence's fur coat as <b>mankey</b>. Baldwin wrote ""Go Tell it on the Mountain"" in 1954, it was set in the 1930's in Harlem. Did they use the word back then? Did Baldwin time travel to now to use Urban Dictionary? It struck me as ODD and out of place.
<b> MANKEY.</b> 
1.The name of a white furry Pokemon with a snout.
I tried to capture a Mankey in my Pokeball, but it escaped!
2.A word used to describe something that is much worse than the word ""disgusting"" or ""nasty""
oh damn, that is soo mankey dude""
3.Something that is crazy, unique, abnormal or unreal.
Yo that guy's going mankey!

Seriously now, Go Tell it on a Mountain is written beautifully with patterns of repetition like bible poetry; like cappella style, &amp; not a word is extraneous (excluding mankey). It was his first published novel, and many critics feel that it has stood as his best. It is a traditional bildungsroman, a novel tracing the psychological and spiritual development of its central character, John Grimes.
The novel opens on the morning of John's fourteenth birthday and centers on the events that lead up to his spiritual conversion later that evening. 
It is partly based on Baldwin's life, his father (in the book) a hard hearted preacher-man of the Temple of the Fire Baptized Church who I could not sympathise with for his abusive nature and womanizing ways and for his failure to express any love for his son John. It's a fine fine novel, ranked in the top 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
The characters are well fleshed out, sensitively depicted - Florence was my favourite being the least oppressed (&amp; maybe because she wore that mankey fur coat to church). Themes of suffering, neglect, artistic ambition, sarcasm, dignity, anger, poverty, guilt, sin, repentance and redemption rule. I found it suffocating and oppressive (been there - done that and moved on) apart from the gospel songs. I like gospel songs: ""You Brought the Sunshine,"" by the Clark Sisters, or ""Running Back to You, or Patti Labelle and Edwin Hawkin's ""Are you ready for a Miracle"". Like Baldwin growing up I was forced to take a leap of faith and found it wanting. Lucky for Baldwin he wrote this book and got it out of his system so he could write other things. 
4 stars for spot on characterization 

""Mountain is the book I had to write if I was ever going to write anything else. I had to deal with what hurt me most. I had to deal with my father"" - James Baldwin.

This bilingual anthology, compiled and edited by Francisco Morn with the collaboration of a superb group of Spanish-English translators, presents a dramatic selection of work by a new generation of Cuban poets to whom North American readers have as yet had little or no access. Coming at a critical time in the history of the island, these poets explore themes of identity, exile, and the multiple cultures that form their experience. Island of My Hunger stands apart from previously published anthologies in that it brings together poets living in, and in exile from, Fidel Castros Cuba.

678,"""Sunkist Recipes, Oranges-Lemons"" was published in 1916 by Alice Bradley and the Sunkist Co-op advertising bunch. It doesn't say that openly, but the introduction mentions 'Sunkist' multiple times and in such glowing references, that you'd have to be pretty thick not to see that this is a targeted piece of work meant to drive sales.
""Now, just a word about the healthfulness of oranges. If every person would eat one Sunkist Orange a day, he or she would find the resulting benefit really surprising. Increase this number to two or three, and the benefits will be correspondingly multiplied, for this rich, sweet juice is one of Nature's most potent tonics and alteratives.""
But don't let the sales pitch drive you off. Right after this the book goes on to give you some useful information. Facts about the differences between Navel and Valencia oranges, how citrus can be sliced and diced; how to grate, and even the nutritional value of oranges and lemons. I discovered, for example, that the white part of the skin, the part you don't want if you are grating the rind, is high in pectin. [They use it later as a thickener for jellies. Who knew?!]
It then goes on, of course, to presents the recipes. Before I talk about that let me say a little bit about who Alice Bradley was, for I certainly didn't know before I began reading old recipe books. Turns out she was a Principal of the Fannie Farmer School. As such she certainly knew her way around the kitchen and had access to a laboratory to test recipes. And this narrow subject must have given her a challenge, because there are 50-plus pages of recipes here, all of which incorporate Sunkist oranges and/or lemons.
Topics include ""Dinner"" -- how to serve fish, clams, oysters, mackerel, haddock and other seafood with Sunkist citrus in the form of sauces, relishes, garnishes, etc. -- Breakfast, Lunch and Snacks. There's German Sour Beef as well as jellies, marmalades, and multitudinous desserts. Some have only a dash of citrus, others have slices.
Beyond that, there are the beverages and dressings, salads and snacks. But rather than ramble one, let me give you the general classifications as Alice lists them at the end of the book.
Meats and Fish 
Sauces and Relishes 
Jellies and Vegetables
Breads and Sandwiches 
Salads and Dressings 
Desserts and Beverages
Breakfast and Miscellaneous
In addition, let me give you a sample recipe.
Egg Sauce
1 cup court bouillon
3 tablespoons butler
2 tablespoons flour
1 hard-cooked egg
Salt
Pepper
Melt two tablespoons butter; add flour, and, when smooth, add court bouillon, stirring until it boils. Season to taste, with salt and pepper; add remaining butter and egg thinly sliced or chopped. Or, omit hard-cooked egg, and add two egg yolks, slightly beaten, and Sunkist lemon juice, to taste.
I give the recipe for two reasons. The first to show you what sort of instructions there are. And the second, to show you that you might have to look up a definition or two. I, at least, did not know what 'court bouillon' is. (I think its a broth suitable for poaching fish or fowl. Veggie based, rather than beef or lamb. The internet definitions seem a little contradictory.)
Finally: The only thing left to comment on are the delightful drawings. There are quite a few and I happened to enjoy them not only because they were helpful in showing techniques and what garnishes might look like; but also because they harken back to that bygone era. There are maids in caps, and on the cover of the book, dignified workers wearing gloves, picking fruit before a pristine snow-capped mountain and a Spanish style hacienda. 
An enjoyable book. I think those that enjoy old cookbooks will find it of interest. The version I read was an ebook, so I cannot speak directly of the quality of this reprint.

The contrast between Lane, who has written a paper on Flaubert (a writer whose search for authenticity is his hallmark) and Franny whose search for authenticity in her own life is floundering seems key to this short story. Disappointingly, Franny seeks solace in mysticism (The Way of a Pilgrim). ",0,1282867200.0,3371,[],jwhenderson,4.0,"Aug 27, 2010",53527,284362,2010-08-27,2010,8,0.0,0.0,2.0

696,"""The Parrot Who Thought She Was a Dog"" attempts to be the story of a meaningful and transformative relationship with a beloved pet, following in the popular ""Marley and Me"" genre, but Ellis-Bell lacks a sophisticated style and, for all but the last chapter, philosophical substance for the reader to grasp and carry through the book. There are several cute and amusing stories of Sarah, the once-wild Blue and Gold Macaw who was adopted by the author. Otherwise, the author comes across as highly egocentric and distant until the final three chapters. In fact, I would venture to say that the book serves as a lesson in the dangers of being a free-spirit and not providing sufficient structure and discipline for pets, especially highly-intelligent and traumatized/needy parrots. We all make mistakes, with pets and even kids, but bird-owners will, at times, be horrified by what the author allows Sarah to do, both in terms of negative effects for the bird's health and in the total loss of control in the home by the humans (and in the ultimate outcomes). Overall, the author is too interested in telling of her high-profile New York publishing connections and clients, her furniture, her sex life, and her gardening skill. 
I enjoyed it, largely for the adventures of Sarah the macaw and in watching her learn to trust and live again (the bird). Still, the book would have been best served by a thorough edit from a judicious but firm editor who pushed the author to look beyond herself and give more depth and meaning to the story. Ellis-Bell writes at the end that she sat and wrote a good bit of the book over one weekend, and that is readily apparent in the bland and raw feel of the text.

What you do have, however, is a good, solid piece of fantasy writing with interesting races and cultures, interesting characters and an interesting plot.
It follows a group of former heroes, from a war a decade or so ago. One is the emperor's advisor, one a drunk living in the edge of the empire and one a clan-master of his barbarian clan who is in political trouble with the clan's shaman. Their stories duck and weave and eventually come to a rather satisfying conclusion.
If you're a homophobe you probably want to avoid this book - the character we follow most often is gay, flouting the religious law of his country, and whilst it's far from explicit, there's quite a bit of gay sex in here.

700,"This is the eighth and final book in the Anne of Green Gables series. Ive slowly been working my way through the series and in the last couple books I really missed having Anne as one of the main characters. In this installment Annes youngest daughter, Rilla takes center stage and the book got back to the heart of the first few books. It embraced all of my favorite elements from the early books. 
Its a bit more serious than the previous books. The characters are forced to deal with the realities of war and the loss of their quiet lives as their sons and sweethearts are sent off to fight in World War I. It deals with big issues, but offers perspective and hope along with the drama. The book was published shortly after WWI ended, so the trauma everyone had experienced must have been very fresh in Montgomerys mind as she wrote this. 
The characters see firsthand how painful war is as they watch the men in the community leave to fight in battles on another continent. Some of the men feel the need to leave immediately and join the fight; others struggle with a desire to serve their country while wanting peace. The women are left to take care of the homes alone. They all believe the war will be over soon and begin to loose hope as months stretch into years. 
We see the hurried wedding of a war bride and the fate of an orphaned baby whose father is at the front and whose mother dies in childbirth. Rilla takes care of the war baby and she has to go from being an innocent teenager to a woman over the course of the war. We also see Rilla and her mother, our beloved Anne, stretched to the point of breaking as they fight their own fear and grief. 
SPOILERS 
When Walter died my heart broke. Rillas brother was the person she was closest to in the whole world. My own brother is one of my best friends and the thought of losing him in a war is terrifying. Walters last letter to Rilla will stay with me for years to come. His words about the power of sacrifice and being at peace with death are more beautiful than I can explain. 
SPOILERS OVER 
BOTTOM LINE: I love this series so much and this book is now among my favorites. It was a fitting ending to the saga and I look forward to re-reading the whole series in the future. 
It is a strange thing to read a letter after the writer is dead, a bittersweet thing in which pain and comfort are strangely mingled.

701,"This is another important book from Dolores Cannon, who is one of my favourite authors at the moment. In this book she reports interviews with subjects who regress (or in one case progresses) to lives involving encounters with, or as aliens.
The alien beings described differ vastly from ourselves, being androgynous and having different methods of nourishing themselves and reproducing than we have. The subjects are often describing previous lives where they themselves were the ""aliens"". A recurring theme is one of beings having to live underground owing to radiation or other adverse circumstances on the surface of the planet.
The knowledge revealed is fascinating, though some of it is quite challenging to fully comprehend, it being so different from what we experience in our present incarnations. As the book consists almost entirely of interviews with persons revealing this ""challenging"" information, the book is not always easily readable. I found it difficult to read more than a chapter or two at once. I was thus considering awarding it only 4 stars, until I reached the penultimate chapter entitled ""A future being talks to Now"".
Here Dolores accesses a (potential) future incarnation of the subject in question. This chapter is to my mind the most important in the book, thus, appropriately, being placed towards the end, just prior to her conclusion.
The future being talks to ""the Now"" from a ""distance of space and time"". She explains that she has been charged with communicating to us the absolute importance of our now raising our vibrations to the highest level possible, so we thus will be enabled to make the jump from the third to the fourth dimension (which is the process our planet Gaia is involved in in these present years leading up to its culmination at the end of 2012. The message is not communicated particularly clearly by the sunject, but what I got out of it was that it may well be necessary for us to leave the planet but that we must raise our vibrations by changing our thoughts to the better in order to manage to survive where we are going. (This is my interpretation of the material.) The subject states ""Jesus tried to show that if you lead a life of high vibration, then you are uplifting yourself and the planet."" No matter what, there's nothing to worry about, as we never ""die"". Our spirit lives forever.
(This material concurs with the work of Esther &amp; Jerry Hicks' Abraham as regards raising one's vibration and with that of Patricia Cori as regards the difficult future of our planet.)
I would strongly recommend this book to everyone at all open to this sort of material, since it contains a plethora of new mind-expanding information about beings from other planets and dimensions. Cannon states ""We are all extra.terrestrials, because none of us originaed on the planet Earth."" As stated, we are also warned about the necessity of self-development in order to tackle Mankind and Earth's impending problems. Everyone must read this book. It is perhaps the best of Cannon's I've read so far. I can't wait to read the remaining books of the author I haven't yet got hold of.

702,"Reviewed by Me for TeensReadToo.com
Sixteen-year-old Kaitlin Burke has been on the same nighttime soap, Family Affair, for the past twelve years. In between interviews, press junkets, trips abroad, and other smaller parts, she's had to deal with a demanding publicist, a mother who seems to be living her own life through that of her daughters, and a growing feud with her co-star, Sky Mackenzie. Ever since the two girls were cast, at age four, as fraternal twins on the show, Sky has been the bad girl with Kaitlin playing the role of good girl--both on screen and off.
As this season's hiatus nears, Kaitlin realizes that there's more to life than being on Teen People's list of hottest young stars, or being number six on Entertainment Weekly's ""It List."" Sure, there's an audition for a new movie by hot director Hutch Adams that she'd love to land, but she's also supremely tired. Working nearly nonstop for twelve years has taken its toll. So Kaitlin has come up with the perfect plan to take a break over hiatus--she'll attend Clark Hall as regular student Rachel Rogers, a girl from London visiting the U.S. for two months.
Everything is going along according to plan. Although the principal of Clark Hall and her fellow student and friend Liz know her true identity, no one else has a clue that plain, studious Rachel is really Kaitlin from one of the most popular shows on television. As ""Rachel"" settles into normal teen life, signing up to be on the boring dance committee and indulging in her love of math, she feels for the first time like a regular teen. And when she meets Austin, a guy unlike every Hollywood celebrity she's ever met, she knows she might be falling in love.
But as rumors start to swirl in the tabloids and as her double life is threatened by exposure, Kaitlin will have to learn what's really important in life--true friends, whether they know her as Kaitlin or Rachel; the belief in herself as an actress; and the blessing and curse that is the media.
SECRETS OF MY HOLLYWOOD LIFE is a quick, entertaining read that sheds new light on what it means to be a celebrity. Not everything is as great as Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, or Nicole Richie would like us to believe, but it sure is filled with excitement!

714,"It is interesting that they had a history together, that they used to be best friends, but I was automatically a little confused from the synopsis and what happened in the first few chapters that Kyle didn't seem to know about his dad and what went wrong between him and Maddie or perhaps he didn't think it should change anything, when Maddie thought he killed her parents and was set on avoiding him. But then the story comes out piece by piece and I understand more about Kyle and why he wouldn't know where Maddie was coming from. And I had to wonder if Maddie was wrong, or how the truth would come out--the only two ways I thought I would be happy with the story ending. 
 Maddie was unique in that instead of cutting or whatever, she got her pain release through pain from tattoos. I liked her voice, and her pain was palpable. 
 I liked that even though Kyle had his wild streak (i.e. when we first met him, he was talking about having a threesome and not just in theoretical or joking trying to get girls to go along with it, they actually propositioned him.) Kyle also had his troubled past, the jerk dad and and not having a mom, but his music and the passion for that really made him appealing to me. Along with the fact that he wouldn't stand for Maddie being called pudgy. That protector instinct helped warm me up to him. 
 This is obviously dual perspective from Maddie and Kyle, and I am loving that style in NA more and more. I chose to read this one because I liked the premise and I love the damaged coming together romances in NA these days, and it was on netgalley. 
 The chemistry between Maddie and Kyle is great, and there were so many hot moments. I totally understood though when flashbacks or doubts seized her though, but it took them down a notch. Until the next time. Or until they played together, their music mingling, their closeness, and the intimacy helps. 
 I liked the friendship between Maddie and Gina. She was a fun character and had a lot to bring to the story. I like how she nudged (well sometimes pushed) Maddie out of her comfort zone, but she was supportive. I wondered what her story was though, because it was obvious she was struggling with things. 
 The ending was perfect, and wrapped up the book beautifully.

Unlike Lasomnambule, however, I think that the writing is pretty good. especially for a novel meant to send a message. Art and politics are always a risky mix. In the middle section, one has to be pretty interested in the tactics and strategies of guerrilla vs. mainstream citizen groups. If you aren't, it would drag.
On the other hand, one of the best developed and most interesting characters is on the other side of the street from the author's point of view.
I was never bored and wish that more novels were written dealing with these issues. A serious effort, and deserving of Ms Klein's praise.
My copy was obviously an advance-review copy but not marked as an uncorrected proof. There were a few more typos than I would like to see; I trust that these were rooted out before final publication.

719,"Richard II is one of my favorite histories, partly because the actual events surrounding Richard's fall offer plenty of drama, and partly because of its sheer beauty. Richard is eloquent to a fault - literally; he'd rather give flowery speeches than actually do anything. But what speeches! You almost forget what a moron he is.
But it's the gardener's soliloquy in III.iv that's actually the prettiest, an extended rant about why he should bother weeding the garden when Richard has let pests overrun England. 
It's surprising to me that Richard II doesn't get more attention these days. I understand how Richard III's hilarious villainy and Henry V's blustering violence overshadow it, but this is a rewarding play.

722,"There's been a movement lately to try to get Americans back to the basics when it comes to food - plain food, done well, with local and organic ingredients, prepared simply. This book is another in that vein, but presented in a simple format. This one takes us 'aisle by aisle' through the basic food types and tells us first what's wrong with absolutely everything you like and then what you should do instead.
Perhaps you can tell from my grumpiness that I'm not completely converted to this way of thinking. As I sat last night at the dinner table, eating my Rice-a-Roni and frozen chicken prepackaged and preseasoned, plus my canned mandarin oranges (I got that one right, at least! I think.) I thought that I probably could make a few changes.
There is certainly some important stuff in here. I know buying local, organic ingredients is best. But my basic objections remain. This way of life is really only practical for those with the money to shop that way. People living on the edge of their income will not make these kinds of changes. I know; I've been there. When your grocery budget for the entire month is measured out by each careful dollar, you simply can't afford to buy these organic ingredients. It means going without.
But what I have decided to do is read my labels more carefully and see what exactly I am buying. My favorite quote from the book: ""Good food should be valued on its quality, not its ability to turn your tongue purple.""

723,"Now, this was a fast-paced novel if I have ever read one! It is split into two points of view, June's and Day's, and in my copy Day's was printed in this yellow-golden color - which took some time getting used to but I guess it's a nice effect. The first chapter is written from Day's point of view and we get to see him and his sister-like friend Tess watching his family fail the plague test. This already instills quite a certain feeling about the military straight from the beginning, and even though later chapters show that June and Metias are/were good people, a slightly sour aftertaste stayed in my mouth - how can a nice person want to be a part of a military like that? 
I did like the military dystopia, though. I haven't read that in quite a while and I think it was executed very well. June is a kickass-heroine, likeable and a well thought-out character. Day has this rebel-tortured vibe to him that seems to be quite popular at the moment and the character does not fail to evoke sympathy as well as admiration. The villain was suspicious to me almost from the get-go, he's quite vile but not so much as would make you pick him as the bad guy immediately. But once you know it's him ... oh boy. 
I do believe, though, that Legend suffers from what seems to be called ""Insta-Love"". A crush or an infatuation can develop in a matter of minutes. But a love that would make you betray everything you have known, basically your whole life? I would like to think that something like this takes longer to develop. Especially for a fifteen year old girl - again, what kind of a message is this sending to young girls? Throw away everything for your boyfriend? Maybe in a more adapted way; choose a ""worse"" college because it is closer to your boyfriend and potentially throw away a great chance? Then again, questions like this can probably be asked for every single book. (Example: Was it alright for Hermione to obliviate her parents instead of telling them of the danger she was facing with Harry and Ron?)

724,"Summary:
This is a story about two young children who are from a very poor family. Their mean step mother talks their father into leaving the children in the middle of the forest so they wouldnt be able to find their way home and the parents wouldnt starve because they wouldnt have to share their food with them. The children get lost and find a house made of sweets. After nibbling on the house an old woman greets them, and the children soon find out that she eats children and plans to fatten Hansel up for a later meal. After Gretel outwit the old lady they escape and are reunited with the father and never have to live with their mean step mother again.
Personal Reflection:
I remember being scared of this story as a child because of the children eating old lady. After reading it as an adult I can still see why it horrified me as a child. I think I will hold off reading this to my children until they are at least five years old just in case their imagination were to go as wild as mine did as a child.

729,"Head, head, who's got the head?
Ok, it really is a book about people chasing other people who may or may not have Pancho Villa's head. It really is, no kidding. And with that absurd premise Craig McDonald has written a book that actually works as a boisterous, thrill filled action adventure that is a blast to read.
The legend of Villa's head being stolen by Harvard's Skull and Bones Society has been documented throughout the years. It was brought up during the Presidential campaign because rumor had it that Preston Bush- yup, of those Bushes- was involved at the time. McDonald uses these myths to form the basis for the aptly titled Head Games. He creates a hard boiled crime writer, his newbie interviewer, a beautiful Mexican girl and throws them into the middle of the fight for possession of Villa's decapitated head (now a skull.) It is filled with car chases, lots of blood and a little love.
Head Games is a novel with a strong plot, characters who are characters and plenty of action. Lines like ""But talking about your plans is the surest way to make God laugh "" prove McDonald's writing prowess. This also shows one of the book's strengths- it sense of humor. McDonald never takes his characters seriously, he lets them run amok with just enough leash on them to prevent them from getting totally out of hand. His crime writer, Lassiter, hangs out with the big wigs of the 1950s- Hemingway, Dietrich and Welles are all brought into the scene. The plot thread that has Lassiter not speaking to Hemingway over a past argument adds a fun touch of fictitious realism. The pile of bodies grows, the number of enemies is ever increasing and the chase seems never ending. And characters from history traipse through the pages, recapturing their forgotten place in our little remembered past.
The other surprising strength of the book is its ending, Book 2. It has its end of the adventure, culminating climax that is expected. But the continuation of the story through the years to the book's and the story's actual ending is a charming twist. It adds pathos and emotion to the over all appeal and depth to the book. Unexpected yet appreciated.
Bleak House has again found an author and his book that is just off the norm into the creative and diverse. Head Games is a serous bit of black hearted tomfoolery that entertains and diverts. ",0,1206748800.0,3995988,[],FrontStreet,5.0,"Mar 29, 2008",9489,310826,2008-03-29,2008,3,0.0,0.0,2.5

Although only one of her friends was seriously hurt, Paige found herself exiled to Paris and spent the summer as an Au pair. All Paige wants is her life to be back to normal, but upon returning from Paris everything seems very different.
This was a very interesting book to read. I found myself seriously wanting to smack all of Paige's snobby friends and Paige upside the head. Although annoyed, I find it to be a good thing..It means that I really got into this book. There were so many interesting characters in this book, some obviously I hated, but others I really loved. The Princesses of Iowa deals with a lot of issues from teen drinking to homophobia to self-discovery and growth. I really enjoyed this book and the writing style, from the unusual beginning to the end.
I would absolutely love to read a sequel especially if its more about the down-to earth characters Shanti, Ethan and Mr. Tremont , who in my opinion made the book even more fantastic!
I really loved that this was based in Iowa! I was born in Iowa, but moved to Texas when I was 6. I have many lovely memories of Iowa. It is a very beautiful state!

733,"I bok nr. 1 fikk vi vite at David hadde mistet hukommelsen og hadde satt inn en annonse i avisen der han oppfordret venner og kjente til  skrive brev til ham for  hjelpe ham med  friske opp minnene. I den boka ble vi kjent med Davids barndomsvenn Jon, ungdomskjresten Silje og stefaren og presten Arvid.
I bok nr. 2 er det barndomsvennene Ole og Tom Roger som forteller. Dessuten treffer vi Paula som bor p gamlehjem, og som fortrinnsvis kjente Davids mor Berit. Hun har ftt en annen til  skrive for seg.
Ole er en mann som frst og fremst prver  gjre alt riktig. S opptatt er han av  gjre alt riktig at han faktisk har glemt hva han selv nsker. Og nr hans egne nsker og behov faktisk truer med  komme opp til overflaten, gjr han alt det som str i hans makt for  undertrykke og skjule dette. Etter at han giftet seg med Helen, som har tenringssnnen Jrgen fra fr av, og som han har rukket  f et barn med, kommer han for alvor i skvis mellom henne og sin egen mor. De to kvinnene som han er mest glad i i hele verden, hater nemlig hverandre. Ole forstr heller ikke hvorfor ikke hans egen snillhet og godhet kan mtes med nettopp snillhet og godhet ... Det er imidlertid det stikk motsatte som skjer. Og hva gjr han nr mamma forsker  rydde opp i livet hans? Klarer han  manne seg opp til  si stopp? Moren som hele tiden hevder  ville det beste for ham, men som helt klart har sine egne agendaer ...
Tom Roger er av taterslekt, og har vokst opp i en familie s destruktiv at det ikke er til  undres over hvorfor han har blitt som han har blitt. I likhet med de vrige slektningene har han aldri ftt noe som helst ut av livet sitt. Han er smkriminell, har vel aldri hatt en skikkelig jobb, lever p sosialhjelp og har en selvtillit som er helt under pari, selv om akkurat det er det siste han vil innrmme. Tom Roger tler ikke  bli ydmyket eller drlig behandlet, og det skal heller ikke s mye til fr han fler seg trkket p. Han har et farlig sinne i seg som gjr at han er voldelig mot sine kjrester. Han slr, og han slr hardt. Fortvilelsen over at han ikke klarer  kontrollere sinnet sitt - noe som faktisk er oppriktig ment, dog etterp ... - gjr at kvinnene i hans liv ser den lille gutten i ham og nsker  redde ham. S er sprsmlet om det er dette han vil?  bli reddet alts ...
Paula er pleietrengende og blir stadig oppskt av snnen som er ute etter pengene hennes. Hun misliker dette sterkt, men klarer samtidig ikke  sette seg i mot ham. Paula sliter nemlig med mye drlig samvittighet overfor snnen, og fler skyld fordi hun har gjort ham til den han er blitt.
Bde Ole, Tom Roger og Paula har nytt  fortelle om David, som sirkles mer og mer inn. Puslespillet er snart ferdig lagt, og nettet snres inn. Hvem er David nr det kommer til stykket? Er han en kyniker som har utnyttet vennene sine med et psttt hukommelsestap, eller er det reelt at han har mistet hukommelsen? Avslringene fra Paula setter for vrig Davids lengsel etter  f vite om sitt opphav - dvs. fortrinnsvis sin ukjente far - i et helt annet lys.
Jeg likte den frste boka svrt godt, og ga den seks p terningen. ""Innsirkling 2"" burde ha ftt terningkast tte! Noe av det som fascinerte meg veldig denne gangen, er at Tiller borrer enda mer ned i personenes psyke. Jeg ble dypt fortvilet over ikke  f vite mer om spesielt Ole og Tom Roger, og jeg hper inderlig at jeg fr svar p hvordan det egentlig gikk med dem nr bok nr. 3 kommer. Jeg tror faktisk jeg er mer opptatt av dette enn av David, selv om han hele tiden er den ikke tilstedevrende hovedpersonen i begge bkene som s langt har kommet ut. Tiller er en mester i  skildre sosiale motsetninger i et klassesamfunn, samt skildre hvordan menneskers liv pvirkes av skyldflelse og krenkelse. 
Davids mor Berit giftet seg over sin stand da hun giftet seg med presten Arvid, og for dette fr hun gjennomg i form av stygge bakvaskelser. Medlemmene av det lavere sosiale lag holder hverandre nede, og ingen forlater denne sosiale klassen uten svrt store omkostninger og nrmest total sosial utsttelse. All sosial klatring tolkes som et forsk p  vre finere enn det man egentlig er. Man prver nemlig ikke  vre finere enn dem man vokste opp med, uten at dette blir latterliggjort og mistenkeliggjort av dem som kanskje burde vrt glad for at det gikk en vel her i livet. S oppstr det store eksistensielle sprsmlet om hvem som sitter med fasiten p andre mennesker. Hvem er vi nr det kommer til stykket? Den vi selv oppfatter oss som, eller den andre oppfatter oss som? I en verden der nr sagt alle har sine egne agendaer, finnes det ikke et enkelt svar p dette. Og det er nettopp her Tiller er mesterlig! For han tar disse problemstillingene s til de grader p kornet. 
Avslutningsvis m jeg fremheve de sprklige kvalitetene ved boka. Jeg tr pst at det ikke er mange av Tillers format i samtidslitteraturen i dag. Antakelig er det bare Knausgrd som nr opp p dette nivet blant til nlevende norske forfatterne. Her strs det ikke ut bldmer eller klisjeer. Alt er fullendt og perfekt!

747,"It seems like everyone who reads genre fiction has read at least one Sookie Stackhouse book. For me, Sookie was my introduction into urban fantasy and genre. This series was something I had never encountered before. Having now read my way through a library of urban fantasy and paranormal fiction series I know that Sookie isn't unique and wasnt even innovative. But I still appreciate the introduction into adult urban fantasy. So thank you Charlaine Harris, thank you for that.
Bill, Quinn, Eric, Sam, Alcide, and Hunter's dad (whatever his name is, sorry I started not caring enough to pay attention). I am guessing any reader of this series knows what that list represents. Sookie's hopefuls, Sookie's possible mates - and various fans' favorites for Sookie. So this book - Dead Ever After - is the book to supposedly end the series and wrap up Sookie's story (except now there is another book coming out this fall??). What happened to the fun storyline of Sookie Stackhouse? Why are so many readers looking forward to the end? Somewhere along the line the world Sookie was in and the supe wars she fought it (too many to count, too many to remember) became less important compared with who would Sookie end up with.
What did I like about Sookie? Why was a I reading her for so many years? To be honest, I liked the routine. We all love to make fun of how Sookie cleans, runs errands and cookies. But the truth for me is that I enjoy reading that stuff. Harris has her own tone and I do like it. I liked the world. I loved how evenly and interestingly Harris blended her supe world with small town Louisiana. What I don't like about how Harris writes is how she is not loyal to the characters she creates or the world she builds. And that is what destroyed this series for me.
Look I don't care who Sookie ends up with and chances are if you a reading this review you know who she chose. But, my take on the ending is that doesn't really choose anyone. My take is that she moved on. She chose her life. She realized she had a business she wanted to invest time in and friends and community that loved her and supported her. Sookie chose herself. I think that is great and maybe that storyline could have been great. But the way it was written wasn't great, it was only mediocre. Why? Well let me tell you!
Inconsistent world building (I thought the blood bond was supposedly unbreakable - poof turns out it can be broken by an inexperienced witch. I thought vamps never got divorced - poof turns out they can! All the fairies are gone - poof they aren't, okay now they are realy gone andddddd now they aren't gone again - oh and they are back again.) Character destruction Amelia, Quinn, Bill, Eric, and Alcide. Each of these characters started out with one personality and ended up with another personality. The worst sex scenes ever. Reading a Harris sex scene is like having my grandma describe an amorous scene. Awkward!
The wishy washy manner of telling the story is what really got me. I feel as if Harris did not have a story arc in mind, she did not know where she was going, never planned on a 13 book series and would change characters (and critical world building ""facts"")to accomplish something in one book. But by doing this, Harris damaged the world she had created. I am not criticizing an author's prerogative to write the story she wants. What I am criticizing is an author who writes one story and tramples all over it in subsequent books. I did not need Sookie to end with anyone in particular. It is not the romance that disappointed me, it is the story arc. 
Dead Ever After was not bad. It was just okay. I believe I may have rated it higher (3 stars) because of how disappointed I was by the last 3-4 books in this series. Harris told this story as if she was explaining to her readers why Quinn didn't work out, why Hunter's dad wouldn't work out, why Eric could never work out, why Alcide wasn't a choice. It was a check list style of telling a story (who didn't appear in Dead Ever After?? Characters who are dead - and even those were mentioned or played a part.)
In the end, I am glad I read it. I won't read the whatever the update is that is coming out in the fall. This was enough for me. If you are at all interested, then I would suggest checking it out from the library or listening to the audio.

Jenny is a great character, and she will be relatable to children and pre-teens. The fantastic setting is a great plot twist, with just enough explanation to things that its fantasy without making it too complicated. Its a great author that knows just how much to explain the magical workings without going into so much detail that the reader is lost. The twists and turns on Jennys journey are wonderful, and the author has crafted an adventure that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of her lead without making her jump through too many hoops or do things that seem out of character or too overpowered. Her helper, Anthony, is a delightful character as well, with just enough sarcasm to lighten the tone when its needed. The villain is truly villainous, and what he lacks the magic council makes up for!

754,"I think the other English group read A Kestrel for a Knave, back at GCSE, but it never really appealed to me. Still, it was there today at the library, so I picked it up. It's pretty short, and there are no chapters. It's kind of an odd format to tell a story, just like maybe a boy is sat down and spilling out his story without thinking of how to structure it. Which makes sense, of course, considering the main character. It's pretty grim, too. Working class life in England back when teachers could still hit students, etc, etc.
I found some of it lovely -- particularly the way Billy opens up to talk about Kes, and the way one of his teachers treats him kindly. The story he writes for the class is a little heart-breaking in how simple his little lies are; for his brother to be gone, his father to be home, teachers to actually like him.
I don't feel like I have much to say about it, in the end, though. I wish I did -- obviously it's worth studying and thinking about, but I just didn't connect with it much -- for all that it's set near where I grew up.

758,"It's been four months since Greg's death, Kate's guardian and close friend of the family and where Magic Bites started. Jim wakes Kate with a phone call to help with a job. One that bringing in the ""guilty"" party alive makes them some rather good money, only to have another person kill their target, yet not them. A little disappointed in the down fall of potential money, Kate goes back to do the paperwork on their catch, then heads to her office. Kate has not seen Curran in months, and given the temperament of the two together feels it's best, until a woman, engaged to a past friend of Kate's, comes to ask Kate to talk to Curran asking he grant approval of the marriage. Then Derek shows up with a petition from the pack for help finding a man who attacked a team with bolts, exactly like the one Kate has from her target being killed, and the stolen maps this man took. On Kate's searching, she comes across Red who asks Kate to watch over his girlfriend for him. Whom Kate learns, has had her mother disappear while with her coven of witches. Kate finds herself helping this young girl as well. All this and magic is on the fritz with the flares, making magic stronger and magic geared creatures more vulnerable.
I liked Magic Bites, but it didn't woo me. Thanks for the wonderful words of friends out here, I picked up Magic Burns, and Wow. I loved this one. This book gripped me and kept me going. Where Magic Bites felt weaker, Magic Burns filled in some of the gaps and made the world and magic stronger for me. After reading Magic Burns, Magic Bites feels more like a prelude to introduce you to the characters for what's to come in the future. I can say, you could easily pick up and start the series here with Magic Burns. You get the little bits of insight of what happens in Magic Bites here as you go, so you are filled in with the meeting of the main characters. But me, I'm one to follow a series as it's reading order, yes another OCD thing. So, if you've read Magic Bites and lost interest, I do hope you give Magic Burns a try, it just might be better for you.
I like that I got a better grip of the world in this book. I got a little meaning to the magic and tech working opposite each other, although at times they might work at the same time. Yeah, sounds strange. lol. The creatures we see here opens the world wide, even the places and magic.
I LOVE the bickering between Kate and Curran, two alpha's but it's always filled with humor. They are always competing for who is the ""best."" I think this is one of the strongest points that brings me to this series. I still love Derek, really. He seems to have a knowing on Kate and Curran, but hasn't voiced it yet.
Then we have the mystery! I like the mystery with the witches, Julie, Bowman, and Hoodguy. hee hee. Again, Kate is not the experienced detective but she mentions that and what she is doing to learn the trade. I like that Kate learns as she goes, and that she is not all knowing. This makes Kate feel more personable, as she picks up on tidbits but knows where to look to get the history on the subject, like in this book with the gods.

759,"**Spoilers alert***
I must admit that the book is flawlessly written, but I can't agree with Junichiro's ideals regarding women. The book is about four sisters from a traditional upper class family. One of the sisters, Yukiko, is a traditional young Japanese woman waiting to be married, always patient and obedient. She is contrasted with her younger sister Taeko who wants to be emancipated and tries to make it independently in her life. 
Yukiko is the central character of the novel. The story opens up with her miai (matchmaking) difficulties and finishes with their resolution- years later. She ends up a happy woman- those years of patience pay off. Taeko, on the other hand, is ruined by her emancipation. Needless to say, I didn't particularly see Yukiko as a role model to emulate, nor could I sympathize with Taeko's condemnation. 
The book contains an interesting image of the Japanese reality in the times of right before and of the beginning of the Second World War. The war is never explicitly mentioned- there are hints of difficulties and a difficult situation, but nothing really beyond that. The main foreign friends of the Makiokas are the Germans (predominantly) and the Russians (the White Russians), and in many ways, Japanese culture is perceived as more traditional but also more backward than the Western one, which is an interesting conundrum here. Junichiro has always been ambivalent about the influence of the Western culture on the Japanese culture, and even though in favour of Japans emancipation initially, he reverted to glorifying the tradition here. 
There were some interesting tidbits there as well. What struck me was both a very serious treatment of illnesses like flus and colds, but at the same time a very casual treatment of really grave illnesses like jaundice (Oh, its only jaundice), or kidney disease. The ability of drinking and holding alcohol was seen as a desirable feature in both males and females. Not drinking at all was suspicious. I am wondering if this has endured.
I didnt particularly care for the translation, even though its hailed as really outstanding. I found it really wanting in places. In particular- the lilacs and syringas were labeled as different species, the description of scarlet fever resembled much more chicken pox than scarlet fever, the side effects of a drug were called something like additional effects, and there were probably other blunders imperceptible without the understanding of the original, but all in all it is a very good book.

760,"This novel was leant to me by a friend and the premise of it intrigued me. After recently reading `Breaking the Silence' by Diane Chamberlain (and enjoying it), the notion of selective mutism in children is quite an interesting subject and I was keen to see how this novel would tackle it, particularly from a psychological point of view. After reading a couple of pages it was clear that this would be more of a character-driven than plot-driven novel (unlike Chamberlain's), so I was therefore anticipating it to be quite slow and presumably, a bit drawn-out in parts as it looks at the nitty gritty of thoughts and emotions. I think if you can get past the idea that this book will be anything remotely fast-paced or eventful, then you will find it to be a worthwhile read and a fascinating look at human behaviour.
The novel concentrates on the Carter family, in particular eleven-year-old Isabelle Carter who has inexplicably not uttered a word in months. Written off by psychologists who feel they cannot help her, her parents are blaming themselves, but at the same time turning on one another.
I personally found this novel to be excellently written, though it took a little bit of time to get fully absorbed in it and admittedly some of the banalities of everyday life are a bit overly described, though real nonetheless. I enjoyed how minor aspects of Isabelle's nature and behaviour were slowly unravelled though and it made me want to learn more about her. As some things are recounted from her viewpoint, as a reader you come to understand just how mixed up she really feels, though I did get a bit frustrated and angry with her at times. She also comes across as a bit nave and selfish.
A couple of other reviewers have commented on the style of the narrative structure. I found it to be a bit stilted and awkward at first with some short sentences, but gradually got used to it and to me, eventually it became a bit reminiscent of Anita Shreve's style of writing, which I love. I also found the characters to be believability written, particularly Ruth, Isabelle's mother, who was constantly searching back in her mind as to what could possibly have impacted on her daughter's lack of speech- i.e. things she had done or not done herself when Isabelle was a young child. Ruth was a bit annoying though, in the way she treated her husband, Wilson and I didn't really like her very much, though I did feel sorry for the family's situation.
I have deducted a star merely because I found that after taking so long to get there, the ending felt a little bit rushed and I don't feel that Isabelle's lack of talking was fully explained enough.
As this seems to be something of a `marmite' book on here, I would personally suggest giving it a try yourself and making your own mind up- though try and pick yourself up a library version or a second-hand copy if you can- admittedly not a lot happens and it is sensitively written, but that might not be enough to satisfy everyone. I would read more books by this author in future though.

When the sassy black cat, Surla, ends up crossing paths with her ex-witch, the outrageous and hot-tempered Idis, it triggers again the curse of being BeSwitched.
Idis was supposed to be dead in a drawer at the morgue, and Surla was supposed to be having some bonding time with her new human best friend, Cathy. Instead, these two enemies are forced to get along or stay switched forever while in search for the last spell book... If only the curious and handsome new guy in school, Jax Morreau, would stop distracting Surla from their plan.
MY REVIEW
This book is BK 2 in the Beswitched Series by Molly Snow. It is aimed at the middle grade aged children to young teens. It is once again a funny tale about surla the cat switching with someone else.this time Srla switches with Idis, much to Idis' distaste. Idis hates her life as a cat and seems to begin to understand how badly she had treat Surla. Will it make Idis truly change her ways? Who knows lol.
So now Surla gets to experience school with Cathy instead of as Cathy as she did in BK1.
Cathy is however very caught up with her now boyfriend Todd. So surla still ends up feeling lonely even as a human.
In this book we are introduced to Jax and his father, Godfrey, who are both Warlocks. What does Godfrey want with Surla why is he paying her so much attention.
Well you will have to find out about Godfreys rather devious plan by reading the book!
Once again Molly writes in a great simplistic way that should make the middle grade reader literally race through the book. Molly also leaves the reader wanting to know what elae can happen to Surla next? Could she Beswitch again and with whom?
The cover adds to the comedy type of feel about the book. The cover features Surla in her mistress Idis' body, after the major makeover she gives the body! in the background I would say it is Jax looking on at Surla.
Did I enjoy the book? Yes at the age this is aimed for I would have literally eaten up the book! Would I recommend? Yes Would I read more? To review for Molly and to help you guys out there with picking your books for middle graders/young teens of course!

770,"Rumored to be the daughter of Death Himself, Ismae has been feared and abused her whole life. When she is sold in marriage to yet another violent man the convent of St. Mortain takes her in. At the convent they value rather than revile her lineage and serve St. Mortain by teaching their young charges, mainly Ismae and Sybella, to carry out his work as assassins. They are trained in the art of seduction, poisons, and fighting. After three years of waiting Ismae is finally ready to take on a task for her father and the convent. She finds herself in the court of the young Duchess, trying to root out those who would betray Brittany to the French so that she may carry out St. Mortain's bidding. 
I knew I was really enjoying this book when I got pass the halfway point and was disappointed I was on the downward slope towards the end. The easy style, great scene setting, well paced plot and yummy romance made me want to stay in it's world for longer, whilst simultaneously being unable to put it down. 
I liked Ismae as a heroine a lot. She started out with a number of flaws; proud; bloodthirsty; naive; impatient; defensive - but she was also smart, kind and brave. Her flaws left her with ample opportunity to grow as a character and her development - along with that of the romantic element - was dealt with subtly and very plausible. I also liked how she never changed her opinion on things simply because someone told her to. The whole time Ismae took in what was happening and analysed it for herself, constantly questioning herself and others to ensure she was doing what was expected of her by her father, without compromising her conscience. I was happy to see Sybella show up again in the book, I absolutely love her character as well. 
I am anxiously awaiting the release of Dark Triumph! ",1,1350086400.0,11636370,[],marybeth1018,5.0,"Oct 13, 2012",60963,64686,2012-10-13,2012,10,0.0,0.0,2.5

774,This book has been one of my favorites since I was a teenager. I feel that Richard Adams does a wonderful job of describing Maia's world with such detail that you are truly there. Maia is a true heroine who saved the realm even though she really was just a very young and naive peasant girl. Yes it seems that she takes pleasure during her slavery (as I read in another review) but what's wrong with that? The broader picture is that this girl was thrown into a world of politics and intrigue that she couldn't even begin to understand and in the end she found love and saved the realm.

777,"This Monarch Notes account will be superfluous for anyone who has read the great novel Of Human Bondage, and will likely turn away anyone who has not. It consists of a laborious summary of the novel rendered in &gt;70 pages, coupled with character summaries, a brief biography, 3 glossaries, and essay questions for students. 
Unfortunately, McKinney's ""commentary"" is truly wretched -- cliche-ridden, trite, and at times contradictory. It utterly trivializes the great novel by turning its themes and content into homilies and conventional tropes. We are frequently told what Somerset Maugham ""seems to be saying"" or is trying to say, though it is evident that author McKinney has little insight. As just one example, consider the ending to Of Human Bondage, in which protagonist Philip asks Sally to marry him and she accepts. Many have found the ending ironic, if not unrealistic and incompatible with the rest of the novel. But not McKinney, who describes it thusly: ""All of his frustration of the past is wiped away by her answer.... Her words complete the beauty in the final scene of this novel. The sun is shining and Philip is beaming. Life has been cruel at times and most generous at other times. The past has come to an end, and the future is just beginning.""  Any reader not shuddering or retching by this point must have fallen asleep. 
Although a brief biography of Maugham is provided, it is incomplete and inaccurate. Maugham published 112 short stories (not ""over 150""); his first play was not ""written in German"" at age 18, but English (it was translated to German later when not accepted for the English stage); he had not ""three"" but four successful comedies running simultaneously on the London stage; 'Liza of Lambeth' is not considered one of Maugham's four most important novels. Finally, the numerous typographical errors are unforgiveable in a work meant to guide student writing. Indeed, Maugham's own name is even spelled in four different ways. 
My recommendation is not to bother with this work. Let the novel speak for itself, and if one needs a crutch to facilitate appreciation, use the Cliffs Notes analysis. ",4,1299542400.0,10935583,[],danielx,1.0,"Mar 8, 2011",40148,35843,2011-03-08,2011,3,0.0,0.0,0.5

779,"Until I havent read this book I was thinking that the strings attached of the title was a way to refer to emotional links, and in a way its like that since Jeremy, the 17 years old who is the main character of this coming of age novel has never had the safety you usually find in a family while you are growing up: his father died when he was only a little baby, her mother has an alcohol problem that prevents her to be a real role figure, and they are living far from any relatives. Considering all of this, Jeremy is even a good boy, he has no rebellion feelings and he is probably only waiting to be independent to build his own life and stability. 
Then suddenly everything change, Jeremys mother has to be recovered in a rehabilitation center and Jeremy is sent living with his great-aunt, a woman who Jeremy barely knows and only since his mother hates her. Katherine is a very wealthy business woman, living in Ballena Beach, a rich heaven for rich people and their rich kids. Suddenly Jeremy looses even what little stability he had and he is in the hand of Katherine, who wants to watch, and drive, his every step. Katherine is probably the Mangiafuoco of this modern version of Pinocchio, the puppeteer, and Jeremy is the puppet. There is even the fairy godmother (fata turchina), Arthur, the cat and the wolf (il gatto e la volpe), Reed and Ellie, and Im not sure if Lucignolo is Cody or Carlo but considering that Lucignolo is the bad role model, then I think its Cody, since Carlo is indeed a good role model, an openly and proud gay teenager. 
Its not that Carlo is perfect or has a perfect life, on the contrary, he is still grieving his mother loss, and his father has practically disowned him for being gay; he is so unsure of himself, due to the instability of his family origins, that Carlo is always trying to prove that he is there, in the center of the scene. Sometime he is even too much and so Jeremy is almost scared by him. 
Jeremy is a guy with a lot of doubts. One thing he is pretty sure, he likes boys; but this is something that he doesnt want to consider as a possibility, Jeremy is already considering himself an outcast, that adding to it also the gay chip will be too much. And so Jeremy tries to be the perfect straight guys with a beautiful girlfriend and the right circle of friends, but his desires are always there. 
Even if there is a love story or two, this is not the story of Jeremys search for true love; Jeremy is 17 years old, he has time to find Mr Right, in this moment is more important for him to understand who he is and what he wants. So even if he has relationships in this novel, mostly platonic, I dont think that in the end he has really reached that level of self-confidence he needs. At the end of the novel, he is still a teenager, still with all his open questions; he has maybe some clues more to understand the puzzle of his life, but he is far from resolving it.
Even if the events around him are monumental and life-changing, Jeremys personal life story is simple and tender, the story of a misfit who wants with all himself to find his place in what he considers the world, and that, in reality, is only a neighbourhood and an high school. Real life is still out there, and Jeremy has yet to taste it.

Maggie Bean is addicted to candy. She needs a few bags to get her through the pressures of the week. At her house, the tension adds up because her dad's been out of work for months and they're barely scraping by. Maggie's gained weight during this time - so much weight that it's embarrassing her family. And they've decided to take action.
Her parents force her to join a weight center with her aunt. Maggie can't believe the humiliation, but neither can she stop eating candy. Things turn around when two coveted spots on the swim team open up and both Maggie and her best friend decide to try out.
Only Maggie's too embarrassed to be seen in the local pool wearing a swimsuit that grandmothers and pregnant women also wear. So, she decides to train in secret, and no one knows except the other teen in her weight program.
THE MELTING OF MAGGIE BEAN takes a tale of a social outcast and creates a realistic outcome. Maggie has two main goals, but to accomplish them, she'll need to dig down deep and discover her inner strength. Maggie Bean will inspire readers everywhere to strive towards their own goals and make them a reality.

792,"The title of Victoria Thompson's Murder on Bank Street is misleading, as it does not present a murder in Sarah Brandt's neighborhood, nor does it present a new murder at all. This particular volume delivers on the subplots that have been building in recent books, and focuses entirely on the case of Dr. Brandt's murder, which occurs four years prior to the story itself. 
Although Malloy is appointed head of the investigation, he quickly realizes that he is greatly limited by his resources and position, and begrudgingly accepts nearly any help that's offered - even when it comes in the unlikely form of Sarah Brandt's nursemaid, Maeve. 
The primary plot of the novel is an investigation of the cold case, but what I enjoyed most about this particular narrative was Thompson's willingness to set aside her typical protagonists and develop secondary characters. In Murder on Bank Street Maeve becomes a round character, and her personality really carries the mystery through.

803,"F**k It: The Ultimate Spiritual Way definitely has shock value, if for no other reason than for its title and provocative word choice. Mr. Parkin stresses that by saying ""f**k it,"" we can learn to let go, relax and simply give in to the flow of life. Saying these two little words can alleviate most of the stress and stressors in our lives because we will no longer take things so seriously, especially those things we cannot change.
In some ways I can understand why saying ""f**k it"" is equated to the ultimate spiritual way. When we say ""f**k it"" we begin to appreciate all that life has to offer, taking the good with the bad and accepting that both are necessary parts of life. These two words can, according to the author, offer a freedom and release that are equal to most religious or spiritual disciplines but without the judgment of I'm right and you're wrong and therefore will burn in hell. By saying these two words and living with the philosophy they embody, you can learn to eliminate worry, a desire for things and end with being satisfied with who you are as a person, where you are and what you are doing.
Mr. Parkin does explain, quite nicely and often with a humorous twist, how one should say ""f**k it"" to jobs, family, friends, etc. He isn't saying that you have to give up your job (unless you want to) or your friends and family (again unless you want to), but rather by saying these words to these situations and people we release any ability they may have to cause us stress. Other than the profane word choice, I don't find that this is all that different from others in recent years, such as ""don't sweat the small stuff"" or even ""let go and let God."" Having said that, if the more traditional religious/spiritual paths (Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Taoism, etc.) aren't for you, then this may offer a starting point to being able to let go, relax and enjoy the ups and downs that is life.

808,"This was laid out as a classic locked room mystery--set in a Tudor-era manor, with the brilliant detective--Inspector Adam Dalgliesh--bringing together the suspects in the end for the big reveal. The mystery, involving the murder of the estate's maid, Sally Jallup, kept me guessing until the end while playing fair with the reader--a rather neat feat given this was written in omniscient, going into the mind of many of the suspects, and it's a well-done omniscient too. This was a quick, enjoyable read. 
However, given James' reputation, the novel did fall short of my expectations--James has been compared to Christie, but although the mystery was well laid out, it didn't feature an amazing twist the way the best of Christie's do, and the romantic feelings of Dalgliesh for one of the suspects was so subtle I wasn't even sure it existed in the end. And while James was good about making the characters stand out as individuals, neither did I come to care about any of them. I have read the series gets much better and Dalgiesh's character more compelling and complex in later books, but this novel doesn't push me to bump the later books high up on my to-read list.

823,"This book sounded much better than it was. Sure the plot was interesting and scary at first. But when it was all explained (badly) by science, it kind of came unglued. When the 4 boys speak with Dean after burying Whitey and learn that Dean was with him when he was supposed to have raped Johns sister Judy, they go back to the grave to dig him out. Have they arrived in time? When they finally get to open the coffin, Whitey is gone. But the earth is not disturbed  he didnt dig his way out. What happened? 
When later we find out it is the result of Deans future experiments in time travel in the NxTech lab that will be built precisely over the spot where Whitey is buried, its kind of a let down. I wanted this to be a supernatural book, bordering on horror. Instead I got a half-baked science fiction story. The explanation is  physics and  biology and it doesnt quite solve everything. For instance, Whiteys beloved knife can now be controlled by him up to 30 feet away from his body. He doesnt have to be holding the knife in order to use it. It doesnt make sense. 
But I plowed on in spite of the horrible phrasing and clichs. In the end, a bunch of the original boys from the burying are killed by Whitey (who is almost comically evil) and there is just 2 of them left. Dean gets the idea that the biological agent that allows for this time traveling ability cannot exist if there are two versions of the body it inhabits. So he kills Whitey in one time and when he comes back in another time just a few seconds later, he revives the first Whitey and knocks them together, forcing them to touch. When they do so, the radioactive particles tear him apart at the molecular level and both Whiteys cease to exist.
Actually, Dean doesnt knock them together, his love interest, Piper, does. This whole inept and adolescent relationship is stupid and I really wished he had a male sidekick so that I wouldnt have to wade through awkward paragraphs about inner longing and cute insights into each others character. Blech. And the end is even more clichd. Apparently Judy got pregnant when Whitey raped her. He had already been affected by these radioactive particles and now his biological son had them too. He came back from the future to rape Judy and came back again to give himself an alibi with Dean. So when the baby was born (at home when Dean was off on some kind o f emergency), it popped out of existence shortly thereafter, sending Judy into a panicked search through the house, leaving a bloody trail behind her. The baby was never found.
With his political pull, he got the baby declared a stillborn and when Judy died a couple of days later, the whole thing was hushed up. Now Dean is traumatized about the disappearing baby even though he had no idea of its full implications. He is convinced that somewhere in the basement of his house there are baby bones. For that reason he cant let anyone (especially a woman) into his house and keeps it even after its practically condemned. But in the end, he and the love interest get married and move into that hellhole where suddenly, a baby appears at the foot of their bed, covered in gore and only a few hours old. Its the mysterious kid who is lightly killed and the bad radioactive particles transferred to a dog that is sick and is going to die soon (Dean is a humane scientist after all) and when it dies, the radio active whatevers will become inert and dissipate. They revive the baby and live happily ever after. Blech.

Babys First Quilts starts out with an impressive 21 pages of quilting instructions to prepare even the most novice quilter. There are very basic instructions with information on rotary cutter equipment, and the use of other quilting supplies. Also, there are detailed directions for matching blocks, sewing direction, and pressing - very important for a new quilter. 
Most of the quilts patterns are for beginners using novelty (or picture) fabric for design. All have clear color diagrams to show the placement of pieces. Most are squares, triangles, and/or framed fussy-cut novelty fabric pieces. Even the one appliqu pattern of Santas would be simple enough for a first time appliqu quilter. There is one circle pattern, Beach Balls, which would probably require more experience because the pieces are sewn on a curve.
Since the only thing that would distinguish these as baby quilts is the fabrics and size, you could use the same patterns to make lap quilts at this size or rework the size to make full-sized quilts.

831,"On the day she leaves Seattle for Wrangell, Alaska  site of a terrible tragedy that occurred years before  Jenna Rosen has snapped. Its not enough that its two years to the day since her son Bobby drowned; she must also be stuck at a party with associates she despises, putting on a happy face while attendees whisper about the Rosens as her husband, Robert, schmoozes and acts like shes insane for not being over it.
Its also that time has marched forward for everyone but Jenna, pushing them all toward a new life  a new world  when her own resolved issues stay firmly on the surface, like raw wounds. Though everyone believed Bobby drowned in an accident on Thunder Bay, his body was never recovered  and Jenna is unable to find any peace or closure over his passing. To her, her 6-year-old son has still vanished. And something pulls her back to Alaska, setting off a chain of events and bringing to light pieces of native folklore she never thought possible.
Garth Steins Raven Stole The Moon is a contemporary novel set against an interesting backdrop: the beliefs and ancient folklore of the Tlingit people. As Jenna traipses through Wrangell and meets an interesting cast of characters  including Oscar, a dog who suddenly follows her everywhere, and Eddie, a man who befriends and shelters her, no questions asked  we begin to learn of a supernatural phenomenon which is intriguing and spooky. What did happen to Bobby?
Im one of the few people in the world who has not read Steins The Art Of Racing In The Rain, so his writing style was completely new to me. Characterized by short sentences, his prose comes out in a staccato-like rhythm that took a little getting used to. It certainly wasnt bad, but I wasnt accustomed to getting the stream-of-consciousness-like details the author shared with us. Told in third person but focused primarily on Jenna and her viewpoint, the book hammered out important tidbits in a style pretty distinct to Stein.
I didnt find the book to be the horror story some claim, but nor is it a tepid tale of family or forgiveness. Its something in between. Relying plenty on religious and supernatural elements and requiring the reader to suspend disbelief for a sizeable chunk of the story, Raven Stole The Moon was a riveting novel  and even though I didnt particularly like Jenna or Robert, I was unable to put the book down. Its pretty rare that Im so apathetic to two of the main characters and still enjoy the novel. Why? Because though I didnt feel for them, I felt with them  and I knew that, in the wake of their sons death, how could I judge them? I couldnt. And didnt. I just read their story through as unbiased a lens as I could.
Originally published in 1998, the book maintains a sort of innocence before the dawn of Google searches and iPhones. As Jenna disappears from the lush, dull world she inhabits in Washington, were able to remember how much easier it was to go off the grid before we were all accessible 24/7 via devices we keep in our pockets and palms. Stein notes in the afterword that he could have changed the timeframe and updated these references but chose not to, and I agree with the decision to keep the book firmly rooted in the late 1990s. It made me feel  dare I say it?  nostalgic.
Fans of contemporary fiction with a heavy mysterious, supernatural element will find plenty to enjoy here, and probably much for discussion. Though I was happy with the books resolution for the most part, those closing pages? Makes me wonder . . .

835,"After the devastating earthquake last week, I wanted to read more about Haiti. After hearing Edwidge Danticat interviewed on NPR, I remembered I had a couple of her books on my shelf. 
The Dew Breaker is a collection of short stories  but I almost hesitate to call them that. The stories are stand-alone but they are also intricately linked to each other, sometimes by characters, sometimes by events. These links are not obvious at first; they are often AHA! or I did not see that coming moments. 
Most of the stories are of Haitian immigrants to the United States. There are harrowing stories just under the surface of conventional veneers, and Danticat slowly and expertly reveals them. Many of the immigrants escaped the terror of the Duvalier dynasty; some participated. All bear the scars, both literally and figuratively. We get glimpses of executions, uprisings and the overthrow of Baby Doc in the stories that take place in Haiti. 
In the final title - story, we learn the story of the dew breaker, the torturer/murderer. It is somewhat sympathetic, as we learn bits of his childhood and of personal struggles. We come to see that the jailers in Haiti are as much prisoners of their lives as their victims are. Fear is a constant, trust is non-existent. What people must do to survive such a violent, poor and chaotic country is far beyond what I can imagine. 
Ive read another of Danticats books  Breath, Eyes, Memory and thought it stunning. I plan to read Krik? Krak! soon. The Washington Post Book World wrote of it, pre-earthquake: If the news from Haiti is too painful to read, read this book instead and understand the place far more deeply than you ever thought possible. The Dew Breaker was an eye-opener, as I'm sure her other books are.

836,"This is a story about the topsy-turvy era known as the roughly 1960-72 years. Pearlstein offers much salacious detail and spectacle in reconstructing the milieu within which a Nixon presidency was seemingly inevitable. Everything was burning: cities, campuses, weed, and, of course, Nam. I certainly recommend this to those too young or forgetful to remember this stuff when spouting off about how everythings going to Hell these days based on whatever imbecilica the local news affiliate televises nightly. 
As an overall theme, this is a story about the battles between Nixons underdog Orthogonians and the elitist Franklins. If I can correctly recall many weeks/hundreds of pages back, these were two Whittier College groups or clubs  the former hosting the typical middle to lower middle classers while the latter represented the campus elite. The Franklins consisted of the rich, handsome, popular types that Nixon increasingly loathed. Later, as his problematic Vice Presidency concludes, the Franklins become the Kennedys and, as the decade unfurls, all the vociferous, rabble-rousing figures  the Rubins, the Carmichaels  capturing media attention begin to expand this category. The Orthogonians are eventually defined by the silent majority, a group increasingly united against all the boisterous crap that seemingly destabilizes the nation. This is the group whos annoyed psyche Nixon cleverly taps for his improbable political reemergence. 
Pearlstein then traces the first four years: the exponential increase in paranoia and resulting deceptive tactics of Nixon and Co. Despite the WTF?!? value of a term marked by such duplicitousness, I feel the authors coverage of the decade leading up to the 1968 elections is the most important aspect of the book (and certainly the most fun to read) as it lays the groundwork for how a Nixon type  a mostly unpopular misanthrope  could negotiate a sea of malaise and discontent and rise to the highest office by fundamentally avoiding, or positing ambiguous responses to, the pointed issues of the day.

839,"Lets get the formalities out of the way first; this review is going to be biased. It's not something I can help, so it's important that you know that right up front. The author and I have been friends for years. We met through http://www.wordplayer.com community and I picked up the Black Gate magazines which had his short stories. I ordered the book months in advance and had very high hopes for Harry Connolly's ""Child Of Fire"", maybe too high. I was really, really looking forward to his debut novel because of the love I have for Harry's short stories. I always hate it when I find myself clapping like a school boy as I plop down my hard earned money. Life rarely lives up to our dreams. 
Finally I got to read ""Child Of Fire""... 
""It felt good to sit behind the wheel again, even the wheel of a battered Dodge Sprinter. Even with this passenger beside me."" 
That is how it begins, soon I was done. I could not put this book down. 
The story is basically about Ray Lilly, an ex-con who is recently released from jail. He's found himself working as the driver for a very deadly woman, Annalise Powliss. She's a member of the Twenty Palace Society, a group of sorcerers devoted to hunting down and executing rogue magicians. That sort of work tends to make one hard to the cruelties of the world, and Annalise is harder than most. She also holds a personal grudge against Ray and searching for an excuse to kill him. 
The pair make their way to the town of Hammer Bay. Annalise is sent there on a job, someone is using magic against the Twenty Palace Society rules. They don't get far into the city limits before running into victims of this rogue magician's spells. Annalise isn't affected by the nasty scene, but Ray spurs into action. If he could just keep his mouth shut and eyes on the road Ray Lilly might live another day; he can't do anything that he's supposed to. 
""Child Of Fire"" whips into action on the first page and doesn't stop until the last page is turned. I said I went in with high expectations, they were met and exceeded. Harry Connolly has a classic urban fantasy novel, ""Child Of Fire"" is as good as any I've read. About halfway through, I realized that I was having the same exhilaration that I got reading Stephen King classics like ""The Stand"", ""Misery"" or ""Pet Cemetery"". This is one rollercoaster-fun-tastic book. The characters are believable, even the story is grounded in so much truth that I wouldn't be shocked to see a sorcerer knocking on my door. 
If I was biased (in a negative way) as I started reading ""Child of Fire"", I finished the book cheering for more. I am very happy to highly recommend this book.

His father, who is a blunt, outspoken man, has always said whatever came to his mind, especially when dealing with his son. As Justin sat at home he had an idea to Tweet one of his fathers quotes each day. He soon gathered a large following and decided to write a book, all about what his father says. In the book, Justin digs back into his past and tells a loose autobiography filled with quips by his father and his fathers view on many different aspects of life, from a first date to little kids who never seem to shut up. This book was a hilarious, quick way to escape life for a moment and laugh at a man who seems to have it all figured out, at least in his own mind.

851,"Beverly Lewis' latest Amish novel, The Fiddler introduces us to a new series, Home to Hickory Hollow where she imaginary setting she created for the Shunning was born. Here we meet at an unusual crossroads between the English world and the Amish one.
Amelia Devries has been living a dual life. One for her father as an accomplished concerto violinist, and that of Amy Lee, a country fiddler. What is a catalyst for Amelia is how to bridge the communication gap between her father's dreams for her and her love of making music without the pressure or stress of being at the top of her game all the time. Not only that she is struggling with finding the love that she had for her boyfriend Bryon, also a musician. Perhaps God will provide the answer she seeks.
When a sudden thunderstorm leaves her lost on a back country road, she finds herself with a flat tire and no phone service for her cell phone. Once the rain lets up a bit, she finds her way to a mountain cabin where an Amish young man, Michael Hostetler offers her shelter from the storm.
Michael has been struggling with the same issues as Amelia, having to live a life that would please his parents who hope that by now, he'd be baptized in the Old Amish Order and find himself a nice Amish young girl to begin a family with. Yet Michael finds a yearning for school and learning, taking on line courses in college. His struggle while running away from his old life is to find a place where he believes God is calling him, and what he doesn't expect is to find it in the music Amelia plays for him.
I received The Fiddler by Beverly Lewis compliments of Christian Fiction Blog Alliance for my honest review and was so captivated by the peace and tranquility of not only Amelia's music but also for the people in Hickory Hollow. My favorite character is Ella Mae, considered by the Amish to be the Wise Woman, with an answer to what troubles you most. Her advice to Amelia when she believes she has lost the gumption to confront her father?
""The gumption, my dear, comes when you believe in your decision so much you simply have to follow your heart, come what may. If ya believe God's nudging you in a certain direction, you best follow that, no ifs, ands, or buts.""
How I wish there was such a mentor in my own personal life and found myself sitting on the porch swing with Ella Mae while I was reading this. How could I not stay and sit awhile just talking to her about life? This is what makes this such a wonderful and compelling novel for anyone to read. The characters even though they are fictional, feel alive as if they have a home next door to you, just waiting for you to stop on over for a visit, and that's just what you'll get when you open the book. I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars and will be sure to follow this series all the way through to the end.

Kofi unexpectedly visits Van in the middle of the night to get him to help him kill a zombie, since Van's got mad samurai skills. Van agrees, but reluctantly because it's the middle of the night and he pretty much scared the crap out of him by just appearing in his room out of nowhere with his samurai sword.

Edward de Jersey, now a wealthy man, owns a very successful racing yard and stud farm and his pride and joy is his horse, Royal Flush, who he has always dreamed will one day win the Derby. But de Jersey's luck runs out when his trusted financial advisor invests his fortune in a fledgling internet company which goes bust, leaving de Jersey with no capital and mounting debts. In danger of losing everything, De Jersey resurrects his criminal past, turning to the internet to find a team of specialists who will help him pull off the most audacious heist in history.
My Thoughts:
This book is brilliant ! The las few books that I have read have been ok ish, and some I havent even finished, so a book like Royal Flush is just what I needed. 
Edward de Jersey is a crook, but has gone straight. He is now out of luck due to a colapse of an internet investmnet which means he is now broke. So what he does is gets together with his old band of merry men and plans the biggest heist ever. He plans to steal the crown jewels. Well do they get away with it ? 
The whole operation of this heist is brilliantly worked out by Lynda la Plante. I could not put this book down and I was with the characters everstep of the way and was willing them to get away it. A lot of thought has gone into this book by Ms Plante for her to devise the robbery and to bring the characters to life. Also she makes the stealing of the crown jewels quite possible.
If you have ever read Widows or seen the tv series this book is in the same vain., but I would say better. If you want to read something to keep you on your toes and a thumping good read then this is the book for you.

Looking over the reviewers of this book, it was not uncommon to pick up the book to read a couple of pages then set it down two hours later, finished and feeling satisfied. Maybe starting the book at 11:30 at night wasn't a great idea, though.
A well written book speaks for itself and this one definitely does. The protagonist is tall and nomodic Mickey who is currently living with an estranged uncle, mother in rehab and father dead as of a few months before. Mickey has spent the past 15 years traveling the world with his parents doing humanitarian work. What kind of humanitarian work? That, dear reader, is the crux of the book.
This Young Adult novel is appropriate for my children. I feel confident loaning it out to the ever-present neighborhood girl who wants a good read but I will have to answer to her mother if it isn't appropriate content. That said, slight spoiler alert, the book is about white slavery and people trafficking, although details are not provided.
Mickey is a funny and enjoyable protagonist and I thoroughly enjoyed being in his head. His sidekicks, Ema and Spoon are incredibly enjoyable, although I just remembered that Ema's story is never revealed which is now rankling me. Ah, well. I still liked her and she becomes Mickey's friend, something he hasn't had due to his Nomadic life. Spoon is hilarious. 
Bottom line: Excellent story, action packed, has a social conscience (the humanitarian work), provides some historical value, excellent character development, loved the protagonist, enjoyed the high school drama and Ema, Spoon and Mickey's overall dialogue.

To be honest, I had a hard time writing this review. I kept wondering if the issues I had while reading this were strictly mine, the format, or the tone. I've come to the conclusion it's a little bit of all three. 
Not that this is a bad read  it really isn't. However the flow of the story is continually interrupted by the placement of recipes. Every time the author remembers one from her childhood, or when trying to impress or de-stress, it was inserted immediately into the narrative. It's very distracting.
I have to say though, I did enjoy her sense of humor, especially when naming some of those recipes  and the directions given for them. 
When I finally finished, I was left with an undecided attitude about whether or not I really liked what I'd read. It's so strange to feel this way. I don't hate the book, but I can't say it thrilled me all that much either. 
At the time of this post, there weren't many reviews out there for me to determine if I'm much off the mark about my feelings for this memoir. From what I was able to find, most have given this the same rating I had decided on before doing any research.
Thus, I am giving it 2 Stars as it did need a little effort to finish due to the constant breaks in the narrative. However, at only 288 pages, this would be a good book to take on a weekend retreat.

864,"As soon as I read the synopsis for Notes to Self I knew I wanted to read it. I have always loved contemporary YA novels and hard-hitting ones are the ones that really draw me to them the most. Robin and Emily are best friends and when a tragic fall leads them both into a coma, everyone wants to know what really happened. When Robin wakes up, while Emily continues to sleep Robin is forced to deal with her brain injury on her own without really knowing what happened that night. Robin goes back to the school and is shunned as the reason for Emily's comatose state, but what role did Robin actually play in the accident? and why was she there in the first place? 
This book drew me right in, I wasn't bored with the story at all, and flew through it. I loved the characters and felt that they were extremely well-developed. I loved Robin and Reno, and wish they developed their relationship sooner in the story, because I loved the ""unspoken chemistry"" between the two of them, but on the other hand i'm happy that instalove didn't occur either. 
I also liked the mystery of the story, and how Robin wrote notes to herself to fill in the blanks and the missing pieces of her life that she wasn't able to remember post-accident. I liked how the story had flashbacks of prior to the accident and felt that also helped with the character development, especially the relationship between Robin and Emily, and you were able to understand there relationship a little bit more then you would have been able to if that wasn't a part of the story.

I have read his book on Steve Jobs and Benjamin Franklin. Isaacson writes in a clear and precise fashion. I can see that he works very hard to write in the idiom of the day and is not far from his natural oral presentation.

866,"""Piccola anima smarrita e soave, compagna e ospite del corpo, ora t'appresti a scendere in luoghi incolori, ardui e spogli, ove non avrai pi gli svaghi consueti. Un istante ancora, guardiamo insieme le rive familiari, le cose che certamente non vedremo mai pi... Cerchiamo d'entrare nella morte a occhi aperti..."". Con questa poesia scritta realmente dall'Imperatore Adriano in punto di morte si chiude questo bellissimo romanzo che - in forma epistolare - ricostruisce in prima persona la vita intera di uno dei pi illuminati reggenti dell'Impero Romano. Uomo di immensa cultura, amante del bello, dell'arte, della filosofia, curioso viaggiatore (trascorse gran parte del suo regno visitando tutte le provincie dell'Impero), grandissimo organizzatore della vita pubblica, Imperatore pacifico (combatt solo guerre di difesa dei territori, comprendendo che l'Impero era gi troppo vasto per esser gestito efficientemente da Roma), Adriano  raccontato dalla Yourcenar partendo dalla sua vecchiaia: giunto alla veneranda et di 62 anni (a cavallo tra il primo ed il secondo secolo dopo Cristo invecchiare tanto non era roba da tutti i giorni) l'imperatore sente avvicinarsi la morte e decide di scrivere una lunga, lunghissima lettera al diciassettenne pupillo Marco Aurelio (il personaggio interpretato da Richard Harris ne Il Gladiatore di Ridley Scott), destinato a divenire Cesare solo nel 161 d.c., alla morte di Antonino Pio, che succedette proprio ad Adriano. La lettera  un poema d'amore alla vita, evoca ed esalta il vigore della giovinezza, fa rilucere nel ricordo i viaggi e le conquiste di un uomo assetato di conoscenza e ""costretto"" al comando, l'amore per il giovane Antinoo che torna ad illuminare la sua esistenza con una singolare, nuova passione; e poi ancora la disperazione per il suicidio dell'amato (dopo la cui morte Adriano far assurgere a divinit), a causa del quale dichiarer di sentirsi un sopravvissuto per il quale ogni cosa ha un volto deforme. Ma il senso del dovere e dello Stato riescono ancora ad avere il sopravvento sulle sue passioni e sulle sue sofferenze, perch sempre ed ancora - dichiara - si sente ""responsabile della bellezza del mondo""; ed eccolo raccontare di come decise di proseguire lungo la strada che gli dei ed il fato avevano lastricato per lui, anche quando le forze avevano cominciato ad abbandonarlo, quando la malattia (l'idropisia al cuore) l'aveva assalito avvicinandolo alla morte imminente. La Yourcenar ha la straordinaria capacit di narrare la vita di un grande della storia restando fedele ai fatti, pur condendo il tutto con la sua enorme sensibilit: e allora Adriano diventa un uomo vicino a noi, uno di noi, alla ricerca costante di un modo per conciliare felicit e dovere, intelligenza e sentimento, desiderio e volont. E ancora nelle pagine di queste Memorie di Adriano viene dipinto con straordinaria abilit e delicatezza il tramonto di un uomo alle prese con la morte e tutto ci che essa implica: il non poter pi godere del profumo di un fiore, del sorriso di un bambino, di una bella giornata di sole. E cos la Yourcenar riesce a far diventare attuale la storia di Adriano, vissuto duemila anni fa ma uguale ad un di noi: un uomo, appunto. Memorabile.

867,"My Review (SPOILERS!! IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS AWARD-WINNING BOOK, HOP-TO-IT! IT'S ONLY 179 PAGES!!!)
I have really enjoyed the recent onslaught of Dystopians... there are so many good ones freshly published right now, and as I read reviews before choosing which to read next, I see reference after reference to The Giver. I have seen raving reviews hinting at reading and REreading The Giver, which means ""must read"" to me!!
I'm a little awed by the Award ( now I have something for my ""Classic Challenge""!!) Maybe a LOT awed by a doubly-awarded author!! But in a backwards twist, I compared The Giver to newer dystopians like Divergent, Pure, Delirium, Hunger Games. Which is more ""upside down"" than ""backwards""!!
Comparison is never ""fair"". Realizing it's wrong, here are my thoughts, raw off the press:
The Giver is fast-paced. There arent any extra words. If anything, I wish there were more words. The story trips along so quickly. Jonas deals with his daily life, the yearly Celebration and then learning his new trade... fast. 
I couldnt put it down. 
And its short, much too short. Ha! It ended before I was ready. 
The writing makes this book fly... and then fall right out of the sky. It's as if it is cut off before its too beautiful. Am I being presumptuous? I have issues with that - abruptness!
The Giver is amazing: It earned its Newberry Award. Everyone should definitely read it  itll take such a short amount of time at 179 fast-paced pages. It adds depth to all the other wonderful Dystopians out there  the ones Ive read and the ones I cant wait to read.
Geez I dont really know what to say. This book was WITHOUT A DOUBT amazing. AMAZING. Unique. So well... begun... but Im left frustrated! Theres so much more that isnt said. 
What about the Community? Did the plan work?! Did people get their memories restored? Was the Giver able to comfort them? Was it worth leaving everyone?! 
Is Jonas ultimately happy with his choice? Does he regret leaving? Does he consider returning after getting Gabe somewhere safe? Does he care about the Community to help others, or did he really just need to leave and now hes satisfied?
Does Gabe grow healthy? Does he survive his initial sleeping issues and following starvation time?! Is he ok? Does a family take him in? 
What about that old Giver? Why didnt he volunteer to leave and dump all of HIS memories on everyone? Was he really being kind by helping Jonas leave instead? How much longer did he last with no help to share those memories?
Why do the memories hover over those particular people? Why dont they stay with Jonas?! Whats so special about the community that they have their very own HUGE history of memories? Do other communities have their own memories? Am I supposed to assume that each person can remember their own memories as if theyre experiencing them NOW? But they leave one person when they go to another, so that doesnt make sense. The memories are a thing all to themselves.
If I read more books in this series, am I going to get any of these questions answered? I peaked ahead at reviews to the second and third books and they seem to indicate more questions asked and left hanging rather than answered. Im frustrated with the amount of questions I got already.
Its just not quite satisfying.
Inspiring, YES, but not satisfying. 
Cover Commentary: I dont like the (classic) cover (above). Sorry. After reading the book, the cover is beautiful and makes perfect sense with the thoughtful old man in black and white and the ripped sunlit forest breaking through  sense, yes, but the cover did not draw me to read this book. The cover maybe draws literacy teachers to require that this book be read because it looks like it would be boring and hard to read and SURPRISE! Its very fast and fun. 
I was emailing Dash's Language Arts Teacher at the Mid-School, and she made a not-so-nice hint about The Giver, so I asked her, ""Don't all literacy teachers like this book?!""
A word from Dash's amazing Language Arts Teacher:
Lots of teachers like the book. I don't like books where young children are burdened with the load that adults should carry and dump on their kids - fiction or real life - so I put it in the same place as Ender's Game. I do, however, like Hunger Games. The heroine, teenage Katniss, runs to be the champion as she takes the place of her 12 year old sister. Much stronger character, overall.
And that's why I like her!! She has independent thoughts!! GO Ms. McCarry!!!

Overall, I enjoyed this book greatly. However, there were some elements that I felt were either unnecessary or not sufficiently explained. Though I inwardly cheered for Victor as he made advancements. in his relationship with Tasha, I felt that the subplot was a bit detracting at times. Although I felt that there was enough of a backstory overall, I still had a few questions left after having completed the novel.

878,"I really liked the first half or so and quite a bit of the end, but when Miller veered off in the middle and began talking about politics and why all churches should be full of artist-types like his church is, he lost me for a while.
Basically this is hipster Christology with quite a bit of social-justice-minded Democrat thrown in. I think Miller does a really good job of showing how Christianity can seem to self-described ""cool"" young people outside the church and of talking about how we can connect with them better. For a cool young person outside the church with a mind open to learning more about Christianity and Jesus, I think this book could be really helpful. And Miller does address a lot of very real and very valid concerns about the modern Church, and for the most part he does it in a thoughtful and transparent way.
For a lifelong Christian Republican who's never been ""cool"" and finds the whole hipster thing rather fake and wearying, though, it was a little alienating. At two points in the book Miller does acknowledge that it is possible to be a red-state fundamentalist and still be sincere and still be going to Heaven, but most of the time I felt like he was judging all Christians outside of Portland for not being as awesome and liberal as he and his church are. I could have done without the politics and the complaining about pretty much all other Christians, though some of his points (e.g., talking about how our ""unconditional love"" is all too often quite conditional) are well-taken.

Brooks just knows in his heart that Abigail is running from something and may need protection. He sets out to break down Abigails barriers and eventually succeeds almost too well.
The Witness has vividly drawn and fleshed out characters, wonderful descriptions, fantastic secondary characters and a secondary plot that was as fascinating as the main story.

www.barnesandnoble.com
. 
Invisible Man  incredibly, Ralph Ellison's first and only novel  is one of the lasting masterpieces of American literature. It chronicles the existential journey of an unnamed black man attempting to discover his identity and role in a hostile and confusing world that refuses to acknowledge his existence.
Within the story of the protagonist's quest for definition, Ellison offers a vivid and unforgiving examination of the shortcomings of the self-serving black bourgeoisie, clumsy white philanthropists, dehumanizing American industry, and unrealistic revolutionary movements. The narrator jointly tells his own, personal coming-of-age story  one that takes him from the deep South to the streets of Harlem, from workaday jobs to revolution, from a black college to (literally) a hole in the ground  and the symbolic story of the unfinished coming of age of his race in America. Ellison skillfully manages to tell both stories without ever reducing his narrator to a fiat symbol of everyblackman, allowing the story to work successfully on both levels. 
The novel also benefits from Ellison's rich narrative style, which drew from a heady mix of influences. He incorporated the jazzy rhythms and vivid imagery of black American speech, music, and folklore in his tale, while also showing the influence of white writers such as Melville, Twain, and Dostoyevsky. 
Invisible Man is an essential book, whether read as an intriguing coming-of-age story, an incisive portrait of an individual's quest for identity, or a powerful indictment of the absurdity of racism that remains fresh and relevant today. Ellison's stylish prose speaks to the individual and collective need to acquire self-knowledge, self-definition, self-illuminationto become visible to ourselves.",0,1172188800.0,2203,"['abuse', 'not_a_review']",goneal,4.0,"Feb 23, 2007",46763,226063,2007-02-23,2007,2,0.0,0.0,2.0

This is a fast-paced action-packed book from start to finish. Karen Robards is one of my favorite authors because she combines a suspenseful story with a hot romance and seldom disappoints. ",0,1283644800.0,5772579,[],lrobe190,4.0,"Sep 5, 2010",59275,375880,2010-09-05,2010,9,0.0,0.0,2.0
896,"Wow, this is such an inventive (no pun intended) book! Selznick has masterfully integrated text and illustrations (and movie stillsvery cool) into a work of art. I use the term art here in the most philosophical definition of the word, meaning the way art can push boundaries of genre and of our expectations and can offer something new to the world. This is so fitting since the story ends up being about a real person who did all of that. 
This story of twelve-year-old Hugo is set in 1931 Paris. It unravels as all great mysteries do, with elements of magic, mysticism, and fate tied into the story. I was immediately hooked by Professor Alcofrisbas opening introduction and my interest was maintained because of the way the mysterious story unfolded. 
I would use this book with preservice teachers first to launch a discussion about genre and what it means to break from generic boundaries. I think this book can help people who will be teaching young people about literature better understand literature themselves. For example, this appears to be a novel yet roughly half the pages are illustrations and it won the Caldecott Medal. Further, the illustrations do not complement the text but serve in place of text. So they are serving a different purpose, or playing a different role, than illustrations traditionally do. And to add an even deeper level of complexity, Selznick uses three movie stillsfrom real French cinemaso that there also appear photographs. This mixing of real and unreal as well as bending the so-called rules of genre make this an important and fascinating text.
I would also have preservice teachers think about the style of the illustrations as related to the story. Is it important that they are black and white? Are there patterns to the illustrations (such as zooming in closer and closer with each succeeding picture)? Why does Selznick do that?
The writing is not to be neglected, however. From the introduction to the way certain details are held back from the reader, there are lessons here for not only word choice and voice but also in how the structure of the text matters. 
I would use this book with kids in the same ways I would with preservice teachers. I think this book would be interesting to share with students after doing a genre study of the novel or the picturebook because it would challenge students to solidify and also to break from the elements of both genres.

898,"Emily Wright was only a teenager when she was kidnaped and sexually molested. Luckily she was able to escape before she was raped. She survived with the help of her friends and moved away as soon as she could. Its been fifteen years since her abduction and Emily has only returned once, for her mothers funeral. Now she has to return to the ""scene of the crime"" because her father has been seriously injured in an accident and someone needs to care for her younger sister Laurie.
To say that Emily has a lot of issues to deal with is a major understatement. Her father was never ""understanding"" in the best of situations and after her abduction things became even worse. Her mother tried to make the best of a bad situation but was limited in what she could do. Emily accepts that her sister is an innocent bystander in all of the family drama, so she returns for Laurie's sake. She also has the opportunity to rekindle her friendship and possible romance with Bailey O'Neil. Meanwhile Bailey is dealing with his own family drama saga. Bailey has had to take over as acting sheriff because his father, the former sheriff, has just been killed in a car accident. He also has to deal with a contentious grandmother, planning his fathers funeral and a murder investigation. Just when Emily thinks things may not be so bad she discovers a murdered body left in front of her familys home. The Baby Doll killer, a known serial killer, is in her hometown. The investigation reveals that Emily may have been this killer's first victim many years ago and he is now targeting her again.
Ms. Lynn has filled The First Victim with mystery, intrigue and suspense with a touch of romance. Just when you think you know where the story is going, it takes a twist that you never saw coming. Some of these twists are action oriented and others are emotional, which I felt just added to the story. There was just enough romance, mystery, drama and suspense to keep me interested until the final page.

Y es francamente buena, digna de la que pasa por ser la mejor universidad del mundo en materia de historia.

Slo en el siglo XX el crecimiento demogrfico ha podido considerarse un problema, pero en las ltimas pginas llega a la conclusin de que las sociedades africanas, que se han adaptado a todo lo que les ha venido encima desde siempre, tambin se adaptarn rpidamente a una situacin nueva como es el fuerte crecimiento demogrfico. En general, muestra cmo los africanos, con todas sus diferencias, se han visto afectados por mltiples situaciones muy difciles (esclavismo, colonialismo, hambres y enfermedades) pero siempre han salido de los apuros gracias a su enorme capacidad de sufrimiento, es decir, a su dureza. Se enmarca dentro de algunos libros que llaman un poco a la calma en un momento en el que parece que frica se est quedando atrs: frica lleva su propio ritmo, y sobrevivir a la situacin actual como ha sobrevivido a otras no menos impactantes. Como siempre, no se ve lo mismo las cosas desde su perspectiva que desde la nuestra. Lo que pasa es que no sabe uno si se trata de un discurso realista o de un discurso narcotizante. Veremos.

905,"I should have thought to read other reviews about this book before picking it up because I thought this was going to be a book that told me all I'd want to know about tea. What it turned out to be is a book that doesn't live up to its title.
I was expecting to read about the history of tea, who started to drink it first, how they drank it, and how the practice of drinking tea spread. The initial chapters did manage to cover some of this, and I enjoyed the first third of the book as it traced the practice of drinking tea through China, Japan and India. It also introduced Taoism, Buddhism and Zen philosophy but that was a nice complement to the practice of drinking tea. From there, we went into the architecture of Japanese tea houses and at that point, all references to tea seemed rather incidental as the author took us then to comparisons between the Japanese minimalist approach to artistic perfection in architecture, interior decoration, art and flower arrangement. 
I was expecting to learn about how the different types of tea were grown and harvested. I was expecting to learn about how the teas are blended, how different cultures drink their tea and how their tea drinking practices evolved over time. I was expecting to learn about tea ceremonies (if any) in different countries and the significance behind the rituals. There were references to tea masters in this book, but no explanation about how one became a tea master ... I assume it's more than just drinking and making copious pots of tea? I was expecting to learn about any medicinal properties in tea, and even how tea is sometimes used in some cuisines. I was expecting to read about the evolution of tea from its simple beginnings to the more complex offerings available today.
And all my expectations were left unfulfilled. The author appeared to have forgotten what he started out to write. ",1,1288137600.0,27632,[],cameling,1.0,"Oct 27, 2010",36239,254978,2010-10-27,2010,10,0.0,0.0,0.5

Most of the same characters from Unearthly are back in Hallowed. (We do get to meet some new characters, who turn out to be pretty awesome.) I found the main character, Clara, to still be pretty likeable. Although she does have issues this time around, and shes very undecided about what she wants, which is totally understandable. I have to say I love Claras mom, and I love their relationship with each other. They definitely made the book even more special for me.
In Unearthly, I was definitely team Tucker, but I was curious about Christian as well. I wanted to know more about him. Im delighted to say that we do get to learn more about him in Hallowed, and now Im kind of on the fence on which I prefer. I really love both guys, but for totally different reasons. But Christians character definitely grew on me throughout the book. 
The book is very well paced, and I really enjoyed the plot. There are some parts in the book that definitely had me in tears. It was definitely an emotional read for me. (I will not spoil it for you, but once you read it, you will totally know what I am talking about.) There are also quite a few surprises thrown in that really threw me for a loop.
Overall, this series is so great. Its definitely one of my favorite angel series so far. I have really enjoyed reading both books, and now Im anxious for the next book to be released!

918,"I loved this book.
This book is sort of a combination of Fast Food Nation and The Omnivores Dilemma in that it looks at what our food consumptions and production used to be and now is, but it also mixes in a wonderful personal account as the author looks at this from her personal experience growing up in pre-WWII England and her experiences there to moving to America and how things have changed over the years.
It not only looks again at the unhealthy and unsustainable practices we now employ in our food supply network, but it also looks at how our relationship with food and eating have changed and not necessarily for the better.
As food science has increased our factual knowledge and overall productivity, we seem to have lost much of the pleasure and more practical knowledge of food, food prep and eating itself. We have gotten so caught up on the numbers and fears that the way our food is now produced inspire in us that food has almost become our enemy vs. a source of nourishment and please that it is alright to enjoy and I fear this is something we will never truly regain.
For all that this was not a gloom and doom, look how horrible the food industry is book.

Vous tes le petit bonhomme sur lpaule du coureur (cest la seule possibilit de courir aussi vite pour nous simple mortel),  la fois lucide sur les performances et li par une sorte daffection pour votre porteur. Vous semblez plus comprendre le contexte politique, les raisons des actions que le hros lui-mme mais vous regardes quand mme les choses avec navet. Lauteur adopte un style assez familier, une langue qui ne semble pas soutenue. Lcriture est fluide et donc le livre se lit assez vite (je croyais que cela allait tre trs compliqu, cest pour cela que je vous dis cela).
En conclusion, outre mapprendre que mourir et courir prennent tous les deux un seul r (ce ntait toujours pas rentre dans ma petite tte)(sauf au conditionnel), le livre ma appris qumile tait marie avec une championne et surtout ma fait dcouvrir le style Echenoz qui, quoique singulier, ma fait passer un agrable moment de lecture.

She has a six year old daughter, who will one day read this book. Not very nice for little Liza. Odd choice for Mommy to make."" But it was on sale, 20% off, and it exercised a horrid fascination for me, so I bought it. And read it. 
In this book, Julie Metz logs, in great detail: her fights with her husband. Her sexual adventures (including sex with a married man) before marrying Henry. Henry's affairs, including graphic email exchanges. Her shrieking rants to the Other Women. Her (pretty yucky) sexual relationships after Henry dies, all unhidden from her confused and grieving daughter. Her ugly attitude toward the small daughter of Henry's longest-running affair (formerly her daughter's best friend). Her deeply selfish and self-indulgent mothering choices, including sharing her daughter's bed whenever she had no sexual partner. And last, but by no means least, her spiteful and patronizing attitude toward friends who (unbelievably) supported her through this ordeal. Julie Metz is loyal to no one but Julie Metz. 
You know what? I'm gonna say it: I JUDGE HER. In my considered opinion, Julie got the husband she deserved, because she is not a good person. But the book is sort of creepily fascinating, in the same way tabloids are - and I feel about the same amount of embarrassment for having bought it that I would have felt for buying National Enquirer.

Finally given a job as a Third Assistant Librarian essentially to keep her out of trouble, Lirael meets the Disreputable Dog and begins reading some of the old texts and discovers ways of getting into some of the locked rooms in the Old section of the library. 
Sam, meanwhile, begins to realize that he does not want to be Abhorsen-in-Waiting and does anything he can to avoid his training and reading The Book of the Dead that his mother has given him to study so that he can begin to assist her in the troubled times ahead.

946,"Borrowed review from mikitchenlady (my alter ego):
Loved this book. Felt the author did a great job depicting the protagonist and her family. Terra is a high school senior, hoping to go to art school, with an overweight mother, a verbally abusive father, and two absent brothers. She works toward being perfect to cover her obvious flaw (a large port wine birthmark which covers one of her cheeks) and anything else her father or friends could find fault with. She and her mother are returning from one more attempt to find treatment to fix her face when she almost runs into a young man, Jacob, who himself is scarred, not only with a repaired cleft lip, but with the fact that he was adopted from China (when mostly girls are adopted) and lives with a blonde-haired blue-eyed mother, so always stands out as something different. He manages to live with his difference, taking on those who stare at him by staring back and feeling comfortable in his own skin, and encourages Terra to find the same abilities within herself. Terra and her mom take a trip with Jake and his mother to China, and discover their so much beyond China and its culture, including their own courage to deal with their home situation. Their friendship, which grows into love, progresses sweetly, naturally, with such honesty.
Other LT reviewers have called Terra a control freak, a nickname Jake gives her, which is true, but her controlling nature comes from years of abuse from her father (both toward her, and her brothers and mother) -- people control in the hope that they'll be able to make things perfect so the abuser won't have any reason to throw words or fists at them, a losing battle for sure. Terra's mother's reaction makes sense as well, using food to insulate herself from this man's anger and epithets.
The metaphors in this book are great -- maps to finding oneself, collages to show that perfection isn't just magazine model beauty, China as a country of modernity and intense poverty. The end of the book gets a little too preachy and repetitive, but comes to a great conclusion. Great high school read!",0,1283644800.0,7560831,[],bpsmshsbooks,4.0,"Sep 5, 2010",35030,422085,2010-09-05,2010,9,0.0,0.0,2.0

""You may ask yourself, 'Well, how did I get here?'""
-- Talking Heads, ""Once in a Lifetime""
Donovan Curtis, IQ: 112:
""Nussbaum noticed my zombielike concentration. 'Dude, what are you doing?'
""I didn't answer, and he didn't really expect me to. He knew me. They both did.
""I cocked back the branch, and unloaded a home run swing. The impact vibrated up through my arms to my brain stem, and into every cell of my body. The branch shattered in my hands.
""I have to say that this was always the best part of it for a guy like me -- the split-second the tomato hits the car; the very brief flight as I drop from the edge of the roof to the pool; the instant that the balloon lifts the toupee and the sun's rays glint off that shiny bald head.
""Or, in this case, the go-o-o-ong! sound from the statue's bronze behind. The payoff. It was usually downhill from there. Sometimes literally.""
After Hardcastle Middle School student -- and class clown -- Donovan Curtis sneaks out of detention early (being that the teacher in charge has snuck out of supervising him in order to go watch the big basketball game in the school gymnasium), Donovan impulsively decides to give the school's statue of Atlas a big smack in the bronze butt. Of course, he had no idea that his home run swing will unexpectedly cause Atlas to drop his four-hundred pound bronze globe. Or that the four-hundred pound bronze globe will roll down the hill, shatter the gymnasium doors, destroy the gymnasium floor, and prematurely terminate the basketball game. Or that School District Superintendent Dr. Alonzo Schultz will come running out of the gymnasium and grab him. Or that Dr. Schultz will mistakenly use the blank form that is meant for listing gifted and talented students for school transfers when the Superintendent scribbles down Donovan's name. Or that School Secretary Mrs. Cynthia De Bourbon will subsequently refer to that form in order to prepare a letter for Dr. Schultz to sign that mistakenly transfers Donovan to the district's Academy of Scholastic Distinction for gifted and talented students.
Of course, given the damage to the gymnasium, coupled with Dr. Schultz's fortunate (for Donovan) lapse of memory as to the name of the culprit he'd scribbled down, Donovan is certainly not about to clarify the situation. And so off he goes to the ASD.
Chloe Garfinkle IQ: 159
""Abigail leaned over to me. 'That can't be right! He's coming to this school?'
""I was intrigued. 'You know him?'
""'We went to the same elementary. He's the kid who jumped off the roof with one of those Gymboree parachutes.'
""I sized him up. He was kind of cute in a careless, windblown way. Great eyes -- black fringed, pale blue. 
""'Well, he must be smart if he passed all the tests to get in here.'
""Abigail was unconvinced. 'Maybe. But he would have had to change a lot since I knew him.'""
Changes, eh? 
There are lots of changes in store for Donovan, and for all of his new classmates at the Academy of Scholastic Distinction when these two seemingly opposing forces begin to occupy the same space. In fact, it takes Donovan less than sixty seconds of being in his new homeroom at his new school for these changes to begin:
""I was fascinated. Now everybody was referring to this array of nuts and bolts and circuits as he. Was it possible that, in not naming our robot, Donovan had just named our robot?""
Behind the waves of hilarity, for which Gordon Korman is so deservedly known, we also discover in UNGIFTED some pretty significant social commentary about the state of education here in the twenty-first century. Who gains and who loses -- both socially and academically -- when all the talented students are pulled out of the ""normal"" schools and given a disproportionate share of scarce resources, whether it is in a charter school or a magnet school or a school for gifted and talented? And -- as I have been asking for decades now --how the heck is it that we, as a nation, have repeatedly chosen to provide far less overall in terms of public education for our children than our parents did for us? 
(Or are we just so blind that we don't even realize how we got to here?)

He is a jewel of a guy and very patient and understanding with Claire. Then I started to say to myself, ""John, don't be so stupid!

But through it all their faith in God and in each other does see them through some very hard, rough and emotionally challenging trials in their life. The author finished well in this 3rd book!

Daisy is playing with her ball when a brown dog gets it and pops it. Daisy is so sad and mopes about. The next day the owner of the brown dog brings daisy a new ball and she is very happy.
Personal: I absolutly loved this book. I didn't realize you could read a book with no pictures. Everytime I read it to my children they make up different story to go along with the pictures. The story is never the same but so cute. I also watched another teacher read the book. She wrote the words on paper and let her students read it out loud as she turned the pages. The pictures are full of color and very imaginative.

965,"This is the book the film was based upon, the story of Elsa the lioness, hand raised by a Senior Game Warden and his wife, Joy Adamson, and later released into the wild. This would be rated five stars except that I really try to be stingy with those. The book didn't make me cry, laugh-out-loud or change my thinking, and Adamson, while she writes well and fluently, doesn't have the impressive, lyrical prose of Beryl Markham and Isak Dinesen, two other European women who wrote celebrated memoirs about their time in Kenya. 
But what this book does offer is what a friend of mine called a ""lost art:"" The ability to write about an animal without treacly sentimentality but rather with sharp and insightful observations that make their personality evident (and in this case lovable) without a narcissistic focus on the writer and without an evident heavy-handed political agenda. Not that it hasn't had such a political effect. A Foreword by George Page quoting Faith McNulty claimed Born Free ""may have done for the cause of wildlife what Uncle Tom's Cabin did for the antislavery crusade."" Not only did the book gain support for the protection of habitat and endangered animals, but the Adamsons helped pioneer the technique of reintroducing animals raised in captivity back into the wild. Not that Elsa could ever be called a captive lion. That's what made her happy ending possible. She was never confined, never treated with brutality in an attempt to dominate. Even after successfully released into the wild, when the Adamsons came to visit her she'd recognize and greet them with affection. As Joy Adamson put it, their relationship continued ""to be one of absolute equality quite different from that between a dog and his master."" This is a short book you can read in a few hours and filled with a multitude of photographs of Elsa. It was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it--especially for lovers of animals and nature.

That said, the story had less impact as told in graphic format, surprisingly enough. I expected the artist to use the graphic medium to enhance the spookiness of the atmosphere and what Harper does. The artwork makes her out to be too superhero-esque in my opinion. Harper is NOT a superhero. She's a deeply flawed human being with a special talent that also feels like a curse. At least, in the novels she is. I almost expected to see Professor X and Wolverine appear later in the graphic novel to take her to the Academy.

968,"Pretend it's 1950 and the so-called ""105 greatest living authors,"" if we're to believe the title of this book, have hand picked themselves -- writers rating their fellow writers -- the best writers and writing that ""the World"" has to offer. If by ""the World"" they meant mostly U.S.A., then I'd say they did splendidly in selecting the best that ""the World"" had to offer in 1950. Any dead writers included? No, though a few, apparently, had died between the time of the balloting and the book's publication (Willa Cather was one) but thankfully, for the sake of the book (and Cather!) -- and since they'd already voted -- they considered her ""alive"" and included her. 
105 Greatest Living Authors Present The World's Best: Stories, Humor, Drama, Biography, History, Essays, Poetry has got that nice musty old book smell that reminds me of my grandparent's house, and namely their World Book Encyclopedia set from the late 1940s they proudly displayed in its own cherrywood rack next to my grandfather's maroon wing back chair.
The writers included in this anthology were voted in by a decent percentage of their fellow contemporary writers. And that's the most fascinating aspect of this volume, I think (which I'll elaborate on later) seeing what a, say, Hemingway or E.M. Forster, personally considered in their minds to be the world's greatest living writers at the time, circa 1948-1950. In fact, ninety-six of the 105 authors featured in the book cast a ballot for whom they felt belonged in a book featuring the so-called, 'Greatest Living Authors.'
Note (and pardon the redundancy but I just want the premise behind this book made explicitly clear): This anthology did not attempt to answer, ""Who the Greatest Authors of All Time"" were, but instead only attempted to answer who the best writers writing today were; ""today"" being 1950. The book is a time capsule of literary tastes, sixty-three years old.
Here's a summary of who participated in the voting: A total of 643 individuals cast their ballots, made up of, besides the aforementioned ninety-six of 105 authors, officers of both the P.E.N. Clubs (Poets, Editors, and Novelists) of Europe (30) and the United States (36); editors of the Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature (70); magazine and literary journal editors (24); book reviewers (31) -- peons like so many of us!; U.S. college presidents (121), U.S. librarians (108), booksellers (23), subscribers to The Saturday Review of Literature (82) -- more anonymous peons, and some other miscellaneous sources (22). Published in 1950, the ballots overwhelmingly favored, as can be expected considering the chauvinist, mid-Twentieth century zeitgeist, male authors, and mostly U.S. or British male authors. Here's the statistical breakdown (since I'm a data freak) by nation:
U.S.A...32 authors (29 men, 3 women)
England...20 (17 men, 3 women)
France...13 (12 men, 1 woman)
Ireland...5 (4 men, 1 woman)
Germany...4 (all men)
Spain...4 (' ')
Russia...3 ( ' ')
Canada...2 (1 woman and man)
Chile...2 (both men)

Norway...2 (1 woman and man)
Argentina....1 man
Finland....1 man
Greece...1 man
Holland...1 man
Iceland...1 man
Mexico...1 man
Scotland...1 man
Switzerland...1 man
TOTAL.............94 men, 11 women.
Australia, Japan (WWII had just ended), Africa (the entire continent!), Brazil, Israel &amp; the Middle East and Eastern Europe received no votes.
The above itemization seems familiar to me, like the medal count for any given Olympics? Except Russia and China are usually up there closer to the top.
And since I absolutely love lists, here's how the top 50 authors fared in the vote. Keep in mind the voting was circa 1950, and only writers who were alive at the time of voting were considered.

The system of voting used for this anthology I won't even attempt describing, other than to say it sounds as complicated and convoluted a procedural matrix as the B.C.S. College Football rankings employed by the NCAA. Mystifying.
What sets this anthology apart from others, besides its endless lists, is this unique feature: the writers who made it into the anthology got to pick their own poems, stories, essays, or novel excerpts for inclusion in the anthology (instead of an editor's or advisory board's selections); with the only editorial criteria mandated being that the writer should include the piece of writing that ""best represented their aims and ambitions of their work.""
The writer's choices, sometimes, are surprising. Sinclair Lewis, for instance (I seem to be picking on him, even though I adore Elmer Gantry), choosing Cass Timberlane over Main Street, Elmer Gantry, Babbitt, or Arrowsmith, speaks, if such a dubious choice can be understood, to a writer's tendency to favor their most recent work written as being their best, rather than recognizing what is or will be their most enduring.

I had been seeing mentions of Grave Mercy by Robin LaFevers all over the place late last year, and so you can imagine my excitement when I found a Kindle copy available through my librarys Overdrive! I seriously love that service 
Title: Grave Mercy
Author: Robin LaFevers
Length: 549 pages
Genre-ish: Mystical Historical Fiction
Rating: - awesome premise, got a little slow
Strengths:
First of all, the ending of Grave Mercy is freaking transcendent. It increases the mysticism level and fixed some of the hang-ups I had been having previously. It is so worth sticking it out to the end of Grave Mercy, even if you find yourself having some trouble in the middle. 
I had some feminist issues with the handmaiden of Death thing, but they were also resolved by the end. Rest assured, things are not as they appear &gt;.&gt;.
Ismaes special powers have to do partially with poison, which is freaking awesome. I dont know why, but I just love poison-related abilities these days :D.
Weaknesses:
The middle of Grave Mercy got quite slow for me. This is where my disinterest in typical historical fiction plots became a problem. There is a lot of court intrigue that just didnt do it for me.
I had a big problem with Ismae leaving her master husband (because she wouldnt have had any rights married to him) for another master in the form of the convent and their god. She was told outright that she would have to follow her orders no matter how she felt about them, and so she had no freewill in her new life either. This does get resolved somewhat at the end of Grave Mercy, but it was a big annoyance throughout.
I just never fell for the romance fully. I wasnt all swoon-y, and in fact didnt really want any romantic development to happen. Perhaps Ill be more convinced in the next book ;-).
Summary:
On the whole, branching out of my comfort zone a little bit paid off wonderfully with Grave Mercy! Ive learned that Im not a big fan of court intrigue based plots, but that was a valuable lesson ;-). Given that I wanted more development of the supernatural powers throughout all of Grave Mercy, I probably should read a fantasy book now, haha. In any case, if you are someone who is more interested in historical fiction than I am, but also loves the idea of female assassins with supernatural powers, then you should definitely check out Grave Mercy. This is especially true, since the sequel Dark Triumph is coming out next week :D. ",0,1365984000.0,11636370,[],anyaejo,4.0,"Apr 15, 2013",31187,64686,2013-04-15,2013,4,0.0,0.0,2.0

979,"I started this book back in March and was captivated by the beginning. Unfortunately, it slowed down about 75 pages in and I put it aside for almost a month. Im so glad I picked it up again because I ended up loving it.
Its a fictionalized account of the life of the writer Henry James that takes place during the last five years of the 19th century when the work James was doing would earn him the nickname The Master. Each chapter is marked by a month and year in that period but Henry spends so much of his time ruminating about past events that you get a good picture of the course of his life up through his mid-fifties.
Toibin paints a picture of a man that was well-liked and a sought after guest at social affairs but one that relished his solitude. This was one of my favorite passages in the book:
""He loved the glorious silence a morning brought, knowing that he had no appointments that afternoon and no engagements that evening. He had grown fat on solitude, he thought, and had learned to expect nothing from the day but at best a dull contentment. Sometimes the dullness came to the fore with a strange and insistent ache which he would entertain briefly, but learn to keep at bay. Mostly, however, it was the contentment he entertained; the slow ease and the silence could, once night had fallen, fill him with a happiness that nothing, no society nor the company of any individual, no glamour or glitter, could equal.""
The case builds throughout the novel that James was very repressed, especially sexually, but its hard to know how much this bothered him. He never married, never had children and often distanced himself from close friends and family but for the most part I didnt see him as an unhappy person. He was a great observer of life and was successful at conveying that in his writing which he obviously derived a lot of satisfaction from.
I would highly recommend this book even if you know nothing about Henry James. Its a beautiful portrait of a unique life thats not to be missed. ",12,1304208000.0,10150,[],phebj,4.5,"May 1, 2011",68257,5609,2011-05-01,2011,5,0.0,0.0,2.25

Even when the main character was given a 17 day vacation where he returned home to his family I still got the same feeling of hopelessness I got from when they were fighting on the front.
Overtime all of the main characters friends slowly died off and as the book went on it gave off more of a depressing feeling.

984,"The third story to feature detective constable Sam Shepherd opens memorably as a container ship runs aground near Dunedin on New Zealand's South Island and the contents of several of its containers are strewn across the beach. Sam wakes up to witness locals descending en masse to make off with the spoils and when she tries to break up a dispute between two men arguing over the same box she is knocked unconscious by one of them. The bizarre Sunday morning incident turns out to cause more problems than this for Dunedin police as a skull is among the detritus and later a body is found in deep water nearby.
Sam Shepherd is definitely the star of this series, fairly universally described as feisty and not someone who always does the smart thing, though her motives are pure and her heart is definitely in the right place. I like her a lot, being able to relate to someone who doesn't always shut up even when she knows it would be the sensible thing to do. As well as her complicated work life, where she is in a constant battle with her DI, she has some trials in her personal life and I thought the depiction of her reaction to her Dad's problems was particularly touching. In this novel some of the supporting cast of characters were more well-drawn than in the first book in the series (2007's [b:Overkill|1971699|Overkill|Vanda Symon|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1207628180s/1971699.jpg|1974942]) especially Sam's partner Smithy who is struggling with a family crisis at the same time as he works on the complicated cases arising from the container ship's accident. There are also several minor characters who offer some lightness and humour including Sam's housemate Maggie and a new friend/suspect Spaz.
The story in Containment is another one of those that at first seems like it will follow a predictable path but then veers off in several surprising ways and I really liked the way the different threads unfolded here. There is the deceptively simple case of the assault on Sam, the attempts to locate all the items 'salvaged' from the beach that were part of a wealthy (and apparently extremely gorgeous) immigrant's household items which were being shipped to his new home and of course the investigation into the murder that resulted in a body being found at sea. In each case the police have several false endings where they think they have found the solution they uncover yet another half-truth being told by one of the players which leads them off into another direction which is very satisfying as a reader (though undoubtedly annoying if you were an actual police officer).
Although I enjoyed the first book in this series I think Containment is a better novel, requiring less credibility stretching and displaying more humour which seems to be in keeping with Sam's character and the team of Dunedin detectives. I really enjoy Symon's novel openings which are full of great imagery and are very memorable and her storytelling is engaging (I read this book in one sitting). I could do with a little less concentration on Sam's relationship woes but this is a minor grizzle about an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable read.

987,"I'm going to say right off the bat that I didn't really enjoy this book - it was an easy read, but it seemed like nothing happened, even after hundreds of pages. 
And so, a list (of the things I disliked):
1. Mei and Rom (but especially Mei) were entirely too ""OH NOES! THE WORLD IS OUT TO GET ME AND ONLY ME!"" I think I would have enjoyed the book more if it had been told from someone else's perspective (at least partially).
2. It seems like Mei and Rom became friends too suddenly - I have no recollection of them sitting down every night or day and writing to one another - it says they do, but I have no real proof of this beyond one instance.
3. There is too much assumption on the part of the authors that we know the back story. Yes, Mei and Rom have little knowledge of the back story, but even they know more than we, as the reader, do. Undoubtedly they have some idea of how much time has passed since the Trinary Wars, but the reader is left to grasp at whatever clues are given (it's obviously not been too long, since there's still canned food that's safe to eat (based on the fact that Rom eats it without complaint (after he realizes it's peaches, that is), but he did worry about his foot becoming infected after it was bitten). Batteries (""power cells"") still work, so unless the future has developed extremely-long-lasting batteries, it hasn't been that long. Yet it seems as though the main characters do not remember the wars at all (presumably they hadn't been born yet).
4. The novel asks us to suspend disbelief, yet it's science fiction (apocalypse/post-apocalypse fits in science fiction), which should at least be plausible (and thus one shouldn't have to suspend anything).
5. Too many names beginning with 'r' (Rom, Riley, Rodriguez). Which, admittedly, doesn't count as a valid complaint, but it annoyed me (almost as though though there wasn't much thought given to thinking up names). (I did enjoy the play on CD-ROM, though. That was clever.)
6. Unless you've read a summary beforehand, it's very difficult to distinguish where Mei lives early on (unless you go based on names, which, of course, you can't anymore because a person might have a name that's completely off where they come from).
I think it's possible I'm just outgrowing this genre (fantasy/sci-fi) entirely. I can totally see my five-years-ago!self enjoying this.
Sadly, this book is part of a series. I haven't been hooked, and, thus, probably won't go on to read the rest of the series (which isn't out yet). Howver, if a prequel covering the time before the Trinary Wars and during the Trinary Wars, I might just read it.

Susan Adger is a storyteller who gave me the joy of feeling that the people are real, the buildings are real, the weather, the heat, the alligator bones  all real.

Art and work and life come together. 
Two friends and artists, Jonna and Mari, who live together, and have become more than friends. Little stories about their lives, togetherness, separation.
Simple and meaningful images of nature and adventure - islands in the Baltic, boats in fog, visits to Tuscon, a little apartment where their studios are separated by a hallway, to give each other space to think and create.

992,"I'm a big fan of Juliet Blackwell (Witchcraft Mystery and Haunted Home Renovation Mystery series), so when I found out she was half of the Hailey Lind writing team, I had to read FEINT OF ART. Hailey Lind's other half is Juliet's sister Carolyn J. Lawes, a professor of history.
FEINT OF ART kicks off the Art Lover's Mystery series, and introduces readers to main character Annie Kincaid. Annie spent her teenage years forging artistic masterpieces with her grandfather in Europe. But after a run in with the law, Annie decided to give up that life. Now, she runs a struggling yet respectable faux finishing company in San Francisco. However, her extensive knowledge of the forgery business is about to get her in trouble again.
Annie gets wrapped up in a murder mystery when her ex-boyfriend, the curator at the Brock Museum, asks her to determine if the new Caravaggio painting is a fake. Yep, it is, and Annie knows who painted the forgery. That same night, a museum janitor is murdered and her ex disappears. In addition to that, an art dealer approaches Annie about tracking down some priceless Old Master drawings that were stolen and forged, leading to more murder and mayhem.
I had mixed feelings about this book. It was quite interesting, yet kind of confusing at the same time. There were a lot of players in this book and a lot going on. It was hard to keep everyone straight. The cast of characters was intriguing, but there were just too many involved in some way. I liked Annie's character pretty well, though she was a little flighty at times and made some silly moves.
On the other hand, I loved taking a look at the underworld of art forgery. Fascinating! It's clear the authors did their research. Some of the tidbits presented - well, I had no idea!
Though somewhat chaotic, FEINT OF ART was an entertaining cozy mystery, and I will continue with the next book. I'm pleased that my local library carries the series.

I like the way Chevalier works; I like the way a work of art is used as a focus and a catalyst. I don't like most of her characters, which makes the books rather chilly reads; there's a distance kept between the reader and the inhabitants of the book which isn't unlike that between a viewer and the inhabitants of a painting. Even when you're inside the head of one of the more sympathetic characters at a very intense moment there's still a certain detachment. The chapters rotate POV among a selection of the major characters; it's almost like an exercise in writing. I'm an art geek, so I love all the details about working in the 1400's here, and the tiny bit of weaving I did in school made this accessible; I always did wonder how they joined the different colors. (D'oh.) If nothing else, it's a very pretty hardcover, and now I desperately want to go stand in the middle of the room hung with these tapestries. Recommended, but not with a whole lot of warmth.

995,"With an abundance of excellent books about the Civil War south and slavery there is no need to read Sweetsmoke. David Fuller's book is part murder mystery, part description of plantation life, and part war novel. Unfortunately because it tries to to fulfill so many roles it fulfills none of them well. By the time the murder mystery was finally solved, I had become distracted by so many other plot lines that I no longer cared who the murderer was. Additionally, with the exception of the main character, the slave Cassius, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting. For instance, I never could figure out the allure of Emoline, the former slave murdered in the early chapters of the book. I also found it completely unrealistic that Cassius, a previously uneducated man, could learn to read and write so well in such a short period of time. Because much of the plot hinges on this development, I had a hard time appreciating and believing most of the story. The one positive aspect of this book is that it presented the complex relationship between slaves and owners without resorting to stereotypes. Still, this one positive does not compensate for the books many other flaws. ",1,1219881600.0,5474830,[],khuggard,2.0,"Aug 28, 2008",55113,365602,2008-08-28,2008,8,0.0,0.0,1.0

998,"In the various discussions/writings about the Civil War, several reasons have been presented as to why the South lost, but in this book, noted historian William Freehling offers readers an additional cause for the defeat of the Confederacy. Usually historians cite the overwhelming forces and industrial development of the North as the major contributing factors, but in this book, we are shown that the framework of the Confederacy itself, may have been to blame.
The Confederacy was composed of three different sections - the Cotton states of the deep south, the middle South, and the Border States. The most vital section was the border states (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland) and due to their failure to secede and join the struggle, the Confederacy was hampered by a lack of manpower and transportation ports (St. Louis, Louisville, Baltimore). Divided loyalties had far more white soldiers from these states joining the Union Army as well as the industrial contributions made. 
The Black population of the South also was a major factor- not simply because of the issue of slavery - but because of the volume of manpower that the North was able to utilize after Emancipation. The South lost its forced labor for creating fortifications while at the same time the North gained valuable manpower to supplement the troops.
Victory, however, was secured by the 13th Amendment. The Blacks (who had wisely assisted their struggle by doing anything to help the Union as well as fighting against their former masters) had proven themselves not to be insurrectionists, barbarians, but patriots for the Union cause. By supporting the Union in all its endeavors, the Blacks gained the white support in the vote for the 13th Amendment which finally broke the South.
In the end, it was the South's lack of recruiting the support of the black population which finally ended the South's hope of defeating the vast numbers of the North.
This book was informative, but a bit academic and very dry reading. While it gave the reader new insight into the actual reasonings for the South's defeat, it's not a book I would recommend unless someone was looking for very detailed information concerning the Civil War.

999,"The Short and Sweet of It
A Pilgrim takes a heaven-ordained journey through hell with the poet Virgil as his guide. On his way, he travels through the Nine Circles of Hell, each of which is partitioned into separate sections where sinners of the same type are tortured in a method appropriate to their sin.
A Bit of a Ramble
What a great freaking book! This is my second time reading Dante's Inferno, and I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time around. The story is beautifully unique, thematically deep, and artfully written. And we have to remember, of course, we are talking about Hell here, so it is also wonderfully interesting in a macabre sort of way.
The story is divided into 34 cantos (sections in an epic poem), each canto detailing a discrete portion of the journey. This sort of specific and self-contained organizational structure makes the text very easy to read. As long as you read an entire canto, you have read a complete short story. This sort of continuous collection of tales also aids in comprehension as you have tiny bits to digest instead of large, unwieldy chunks. The structure of the version I read complements this well in that each canto begins with a prose summation of the canto and ends with the translator/editor's notes. This sort of bookending forces (in the kindest possible way) readers to contemplate the section both as a distinct entity and as part of the larger whole.
But enough of the dry, formalist details. Let's get to the nitty-gritty, guilty pleasure portion of the review. For those of you out there who, like me, find the unusual, the disturbing, and the mildly grotesque to be entertaining, this is the book for you. Specific sins are laid out individually in the text and the horrific punishments are explained in a rather detailed fashion. There is dismemberment, disembowelment, burning, drowning, metamorphoses, confusion, despair, torture, torture, torture. Again...this is Hell we are talking about here, and very much in the Old Testament, non-forgiving tradition.
So you don't think I'm some sort of sadistic or just disgusting person, these abuses are revealed through quite artful language, and of course, the punishments are perfectly fitting for the crime. In the third Canto, Virgil and Dante the Pilgrim are about to enter Hell, but before coming to the entrance, they see a group of souls caught in a no man's land. These are people who, while alive, refused to take a stance. Their inability to make a choice means they are neither rewarded with Heaven nor fully punished in Hell. Instead they are doomed to ceaselessly run after a banner forever and ever. How perfect is that?
Flatterers are submerged in excrement - they were after all ""full of shit"" in life (can you believe how far back that sayings' origins are?). Usurers (more commonly called loan sharks) squat on burning sand while fire rains down upon them; their faces are indistinguishable and only the money bags that hang around their necks offer any sort of differentiation. Those who promoted rifts between peoples and nations while alive walk in a circle, being hacked in half, healing as they walk only to be hacked again.
I could go on and on as many sins are covered. For those who may be wondering, the answer is no. You do not have to be religious at all to enjoy the experience; nor do you have to agree that the sins listed are in fact sins. All you need is an appreciation of karma, good writing, and entertaining twists.
If there is one problem with the book, it is this: the text is chock-full of name-dropping. While this probably meant a lot back in 1314, the use of famous and infamous names isn't quite so relevant for today's reader. Most will recognize quite a few of the references - Virgil, Ulysses/Odysseus, Homer, Medusa, Hippocrates, etc. - but there is a whole host of names that will mean nothing to a modern reader. At times, it's a bit cumbersome, but luckily it is not necessary to know the history in order to understand the text. Plus, if you want to know who these people are, as I did, the Notes section has you covered (in this translation anyway).
If you have not yet picked this up because it was written almost seven hundred years ago, don't let that worry you. The ideas, the metaphors, it's still relevant and understandable and interesting.
